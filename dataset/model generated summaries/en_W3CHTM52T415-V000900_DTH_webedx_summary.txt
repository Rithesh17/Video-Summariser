- Track events include 'cuenter' and 'cueexit,' indicating cue entry and exit times, which can be displayed in sync with video.
- VTT files specify start and end times for cues, triggering cueenter and cueexit events.
- JavaScript's readContent method iterates over cues and adds individual enter and exit listeners to each.
- Cue enter listeners display the cue ID and text, while exit listeners display the exited cue ID.
- As of December 2015, Firefox doesn't support individual cue listeners, requiring a fallback 'cuechange' event listener on the track.
- The cuechange listener provides a list of active cues, typically including only one cue.
- The fallback method displays the first active cue during video playback, highlighting the current cue in a transcript.
