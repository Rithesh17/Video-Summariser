- An ALU (Arithmetic and Logic Unit) is the "mathematical brain" of a computer that performs calculations and logical operations.
- The simplest adding circuit is a "half adder" that adds two binary digits and produces a sum and carry bit.
- A "full adder" is a more complex circuit that adds three binary digits and handles the carry bit.
- An 8-bit ripple carry adder adds two 8-bit binary numbers by connecting half and full adders in a chain.
- The arithmetic unit of an ALU also performs other math operations, such as subtraction and incrementing, by combining logic gates.
- The logic unit of an ALU performs logical operations, such as AND, OR, and NOT, and tests numerical conditions.
- ALUs use flags to indicate specific statuses, such as zero, negative, and overflow, which are used to control program execution.
