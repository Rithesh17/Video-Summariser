* Image processing involves analyzing and manipulating images using tools and code.
* Python is commonly used in data science and AI projects to work with image data.
* Images are represented as a three-dimensional matrix of pixel values to computer software.
* Matplotlib is used for data visualizations, including image reading, writing, and display.
* The Python Image Library (PIL/Pillow) provides functions for image manipulation and supports various image types.
* OpenCV is a library for Python-based computer vision programming.
* Scikit-Image applies statistical and mathematical functions to image data for analysis and modelling.
* NumPy arrays are the ideal format for sharing image data across different image processing packages.
