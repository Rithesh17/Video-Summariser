- Single binary values represent numbers; 0 and 1 can be used to represent "true" and "false," allowing for information beyond these two values.
- Binary numbers work similarly to decimal numbers, using a base-two system with multipliers that are powers of two.
- Each binary digit (bit) represents a certain value, with a range of 0-255 in 8-bit systems.
- Computers represent negative numbers using the first bit, typically reserving 31 bits for the number itself.
- 64-bit numbers expand the range of representable values to around 9.2 quintillion.
- Computers use floating-point numbers to represent non-whole numbers, with a significand and exponent.
- Text is represented in computers using encoding schemes like ASCII, which assign binary numbers to letters.
- Unicode provides a universal encoding scheme for characters from multiple languages.
