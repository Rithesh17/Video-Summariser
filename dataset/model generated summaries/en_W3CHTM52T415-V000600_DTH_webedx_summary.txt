- HTML track elements can be manipulated in JavaScript to determine which track is loaded and active.
- The `htmlTracks` variable retrieves all track elements using `querySelectorAll()`.
- The `displayTrackStatuses()` function displays track information in the console, including label, kind, and language.
- The `readyState` property indicates the track's status: 0 (unavailable), 2 (loaded).
- A button is added to refresh the track statuses.
- Using the Safari browser's track-switching menu demonstrates how track statuses change accordingly.
- These attributes will be used in a future video to create a menu for selecting tracks programmatically.
