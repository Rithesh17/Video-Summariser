- Scikit-learn supports building models based on classical machine learning techniques rooted in statistics and regression-based mathematics.
- Classical machine learning techniques offer high performance and ease of implementation, making them widely used in AI solutions.
- Limitations in computer vision applications arise due to image pixel arrays being susceptible to variations in color, contrast, and lighting conditions.
- Equalizing and preparing images can mitigate susceptibility to image variations, but it requires significant effort.
- Classical machine learning techniques consider the entire pixel array, which can be problematic as not all pixels represent object features.
- Background pixels without relevance to object classification can heavily influence classical algorithms due to being part of the pixel array.
- Advanced AI solutions often require deep learning techniques that overcome the limitations of classical machine learning for complex tasks.
