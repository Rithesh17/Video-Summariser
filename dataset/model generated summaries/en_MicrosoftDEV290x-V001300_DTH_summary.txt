- Classification tasks often involve predicting species based on numerical measurements (e.g., iris flower sepals and petals).
- To predict species from images, images are converted into matrices and then flattened into vectors.
- The pixel values of images form the feature vectors, while the species labels form the class labels.
- The feature vectors and class labels are used to train and validate a machine learning model.
- After training, new images can be processed, and their pixel value features can be used for prediction.
- The model can then predict the species of the iris flower in the image.
- This approach demonstrates the use of image data in classification tasks.
