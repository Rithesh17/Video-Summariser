- Mathematical morphology involves using mathematical operations to manipulate images.
- Dilation enlarges images by extending pixels and filling holes using a structuring element.
- Erosion removes pixels and fine details by setting target cells to 255 or zero based on cell matches.
- Closing applies dilation followed by erosion, effectively closing gaps and filling holes in shapes.
- Opening is the opposite of closing, consisting of erosion followed by dilation.
- Structuring elements can vary in shape and are used as templates for matching image cells.
- The logical operations OR and AND are used in dilation and erosion, respectively.
