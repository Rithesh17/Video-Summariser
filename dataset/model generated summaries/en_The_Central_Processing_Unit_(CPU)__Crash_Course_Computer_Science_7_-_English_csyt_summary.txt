- Processors are the heart of any computer, responsible for executing programs and performing calculations.
- A CPU consists of a RAM module, registers, an Arithmetic and Logic Unit (ALU), an instruction address register, and an instruction register.
- The fetch phase involves retrieving an instruction from memory, while the decode phase interprets the instruction's opcode.
- The execute phase performs the instruction by configuring the ALU and other components based on the decoded opcode.
- The Control Unit directs the flow of data and operations within the CPU, acting as the conductor of an orchestra.
- Clock speed, measured in Hertz, determines the frequency at which the CPU executes cycles.
- CPUs can be overclocked (increased clock speed) or underclocked (decreased clock speed) to optimize performance or save power.
- The design principles of this simplified CPU model are still evident in modern processors.
