- Ranges are sequences of integers used in for loops and are created using the "range" function.
- Ranges specify a stopping value, which Python excludes from the sequence.
- Ranges can include a starting point and a step size, customizing the sequence generated.
- It is generally recommended to avoid converting ranges to lists, as ranges are more efficient for looping.
- Ranges store only three values (starting number, stopping number, step size), while lists store the entire sequence.
- Converting large ranges to lists wastes memory due to unnecessary duplication of data.
- Ranges are more commonly used in for loops directly, without prior conversion to lists.
