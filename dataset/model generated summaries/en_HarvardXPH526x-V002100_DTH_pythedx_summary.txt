- Expressions involve boolean data type, which takes values True or False and must be capitalized.
- Boolean operations ("or", "and", "not") take boolean objects and return boolean results.
- "Or" returns True if either argument is True.
- "And" returns True only if both arguments are True.
- "Not" negates the value of its argument.
- Python provides eight comparison operations for various types, including numbers and sequences.
- Comparisons return boolean results, True or False.
- The "is" and "is not" operations test object identity, while other comparison operations test value equality.
