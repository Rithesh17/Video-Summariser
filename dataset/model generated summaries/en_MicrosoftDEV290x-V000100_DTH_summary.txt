- Statistical analysis and manipulation of pixel values are key in traditional image processing.
- Contrast is crucial for identifying features, but challenging lighting conditions can affect it.
- Pixel values range from 0-255 and can be plotted in a histogram showing their frequency.
- The cumulative distribution function (CDF) shows the cumulative distribution of pixel intensities.
- Contrast stretching scales pixel values to improve contrast by evenly distributing them.
- Histogram normalization flattens the histogram and produces a uniform CDF for improved contrast.
- Python libraries simplify the process of adjusting contrast using these techniques.
