- Strings in Python are immutable and can be enclosed in quotes or triple quotes.
- Common sequence operations on strings include finding length (len()), accessing elements (using indices), and slicing (specifying start and end points).
- Strings support membership testing (e.g., "y" in S) to check if a character is present.
- Polymorphism allows operators to behave differently depending on object types (e.g., "+" means addition for numbers, concatenation for strings).
- Strings can be concatenated (joined together) using the "+" operator, which creates a new string.
- Strings have their own methods that allow for manipulation, such as the "replace" method to substitute characters or the "split" method to break down strings into substrings.
