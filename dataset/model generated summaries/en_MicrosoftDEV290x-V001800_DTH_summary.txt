- Classical machine learning involves defining functions to predict a label value (y) based on input features (x), typically using algorithms like logistic regression to determine coefficients.
- Deep learning mimics the human brain by using artificial neurons with weighted inputs (x), bias (b), and an activation function to determine firing or non-firing (y).
- Artificial neurons are interconnected in layers, with weighted connections between neurons allowing for complex function approximation.
- The loss function measures the difference between predicted probabilities and known labels, indicating the amount of error in the model.
- The gradient of the loss function guides adjustments to weights and biases to reduce loss, a process known as backpropagation.
- Training a neural network involves feeding input data with known labels and iteratively adjusting weights and biases to minimize loss through epochs (cycles of training and validation).
- GPUs are optimized for the linear algebra calculations used in training deep learning models, making them commonly used for this purpose.
