- Sequences in Python are ordered collections of objects.
- Basic sequence types include lists, tuples, and range objects.
- Indexing for sequences starts at 0, with the first element accessed via s[0].
- Negative indexing can be used to access elements from the right, with s[-1] being the last element.
- Slicing allows for the extraction of multiple elements, specified by a start and stop position, excluding the element at the stop position.
- Sequences share common operations, but different types have unique methods.
- Objects within a sequence form an ordered sequence of positions.
