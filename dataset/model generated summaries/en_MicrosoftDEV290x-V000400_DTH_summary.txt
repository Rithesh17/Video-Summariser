- Image manipulation includes rotating, transposing, and flipping images.
- Resizing images involves changing the size of pixel arrays.
- Image aspect ratio should be maintained to avoid distortion.
- Proportional resizing adjusts the longest dimension to the required size.
- Images can be overlaid onto a background of the correct dimensions to create padding.
- This "mounting" technique prevents image squashing or stretching.
- Resizing images helps prepare image data for computer vision models.
