Topic: Tuples in Python
* Tuples are immutable sequences typically used to store heterogenous data
* Usually use when you want to return a multiple outputs from a function
* len(t) returns the length of tuple t
* T1 + T2 gives us a new concatenated tuple contained all of the objects of T1 and T2
* Accessing an element is much like a list where you access with t[index
* Unpack the tuple by doing (v1, v2) = t where v1 = t[0] and v2 = t[1]
* You can get away without using parentheses when making a tuple, however, it becomes harder to tell when you are working with a tuple
* To make tuple of length 1, do t = (v1,)
