Topic: Python Sequences
* Sequence is a collection of objects order by position
* 3 Basic Sequence Types
   * List, Tuple, Ranges Objects
   * List type for string
* Any sequence will support common sequence operations, but each will have their own methods
* Indexing starts at 0, being accessed as s[0]
* Negative indexing allows to count from right to left instead - s[-1] == last element
* Slicing allows extraction of multiple elements, specified by a start followed by a stop position -  s[0:2]
