* Topic: Arithmetic in Python
* Python provides three numeric types: integers, floating point numbers, and complex numbers.
* Python integers have unlimited precision, never becoming too long to fit within the type.
* Python numbers support all arithmetic operations, including addition, multiplication, power, division, and floor division.
* Floor division uses two slashes (//) and rounds the result to the closest integer less than the floating point answer.
* The underscore operator (_) represents the last returned Python object, simplifying calculations.
* Python's math module provides additional mathematical operations, such as the factorial function.
* The factorial function calculates the product of a number multiplied by all smaller positive integers (e.g., 3! = 3 * 2 * 1 = 6).
