Topic: Python Dictionaries
* Dictionaries are mappings from keys to values, with immutable keys and modifiable values.
* Dictionaries allow for efficient look-ups on unordered data.
* Key-value pairs in dictionaries are not stored in any specific order.
* Dictionaries can be created using curly braces or the "dict" keyword.
* You can create a key value pair by doing dictionary[key] = value
* Values associated with keys can be modified using dictionary syntax, such as "dictionary[key] += value".
* The ".keys()" and ".values()" methods can be used to retrieve views of the dictionary's keys and values as a view object, respectively.
* Membership testing in dictionaries can be performed using the "in" operator, which checks if a key exists.
