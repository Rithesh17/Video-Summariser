- Example of a video associated with multiple different subtitle tracks.
- Google Chrome displays the subtitles labelled with the default tag and has a CC button to enable/disable them.
- Firefox loads the first track with the default attribute, but does not provide a menu or CC button for selecting subtitles.
- Safari displays a subtitle menu, allowing users to choose between tracks and switch to English subtitles.
- Internet Explorer and Microsoft Edge may offer similar subtitle features to Safari.
- The Track API allows developers to interact with tracks, such as activating them or selecting languages.
- Tracks are composed of cues, which are time segments defined by a start and end time, marked with an numeric ID and text content in HTML.
- You can set the name of the speaker by doing <v speaker_name>
- Security constraints can prevent cross-origin access to videos and subtitles, which can be resolved by adding the crossOrigin="anonymous" attribute.
