in this video let's delve deeper and get even better intuition about what the cost function is doing this video assumes that you're familiar with contour plots if you're not familiar with contour plots or contour figures some of the illustrations in this video may or may not make sense to you but it's okay and if you end up skipping this video or if some of it doesn't quite make sense because you haven't seen contour plots before that's okay and you still understand the rest of this course without those parts of it here's our problem formulation as usual with the hypothesis parameters cost function and our optimization objective unlike before unlike the last video I'm going to keep both of my parameters theta 0 and theta 1 as we generate our visualizations for the cost function so same as last time we want to understand the hypothesis H and the cost function J so here's my training set of housing prices and let's make some hypothesis you know like that one this is not a particularly good hypothesis but if I set theta 0 equals 50 and theta one equals 0.06 then I end up with this hypothesis down here and that corresponds to that straight line now given these values of theta zero and theta one we want to plot the corresponding you know cost function on the right what we did last time was regular where we only had theta one you know we're drawing plots that look like this as a function of theta one but now we have two parameters theta zero and theta one and so the plot gets a little more complicated it turns out that when we have only one parameter the plus we drew had this sort of bow shaped function now when we have two parameters it turns out the cost function also has a similar sort of bow shape and in fact depending on your training set you might get a cost function that maybe looks something like this so this is a 3d surface plot where the axes are labeled theta 0 and theta one so as you vary theta zero and theta one to two parameters you get different values of the cost function J of theta zero comma theta one and the height of the surface above a particular point of theta zero theta one right that's the vertical axis the height of the surface at the point indicates the value of J of theta zero comma J of theta one and you can see it sort of has this bow like shape let me show you the same part in 3d so here's the same figure in 3d with axis a zero theta one and vertical axis J of theta zero theta one and if I rotate this your plot around you kind of get a sense I hope this bell shaped surface is that's what the cost function J looks like now for the purpose of illustration in the rest of this video I'm not actually going to use these sorts of 3d surfaces to show you the cost function J instead I'm going to use contour plots or what I also call contour figures I guess they mean the same thing to show you these surfaces so here's an example of a contour figure shown on the right where the axes are theta zero and theta one and one of each of these ovals what each of these ellipses shows is a set of points that takes on the same value for J of theta zero theta one so completely for example let's you know take that point at that point at that point all three of these points like just drew a magenta they have the same value for J of theta zero theta one okay where write these this is a theta zero theta one axis but those three have the same value for J of theta zero comma theta one and if you haven't seen console parts much before think of imagine if you will a bowl shape function that's coming out at my screen so that the minimum so the bottom of the bowl is this right there right this middle the middle of these concentric ellipses and imagine a bow shape that's of grows out my screen like this so that each of these ellipses you know has the same height above my screen and the minimum of the bow right is right down there and so the contour figures is a way to is it maybe a more convenient way to visualize my function J so let's look at some examples over here I have a particular point right and so this is a with you know theta zero equals me about eight hundred and feita one equals maybe a minus 0.15 and so this point right is this point in red corresponds to one Pacific pair of values of theta zero comma theta one and they correspond in fact to that hypothesis right with theta zero is about 800 meters intersects the vertical axis around 800 and this is a slope of about minus 0.15 now this line is really not such a good fit to the data right this hypothesis H of X with these values of theta 0 theta 1 3 not such a good fit to the data and so you find that is cost as a value that's out here let's feel pretty far from the minimum right so it's pretty far it's in a pretty high cost because this is just not that good fit to the data let's look at some more examples now here's the different hypothesis that's you know still not a great fit of the data there may be slightly better so here right that's my point that those are my parameters theta zero theta one and so my theta zero value right that's um about 360 and my value for theta one is equal to 0 so you know let's write that out the state of 0 equals 360 theta 1 equals 0 and this pair of parameters corresponds to that hypothesis corresponds to a flat line right this is H of x equals 360 plus zero times X so that's my hypothesis and this hypothesis again has some cost and that causes you know plotted as the height of the J function at that point let's look at just a couple of examples here's one more you know at this value of theta zero and then that value of theta one we end up with this hypothesis H of X and again not a great fit to the data and just I can move even further out for the mineral last example this is actually not quite at the minimum but it's pretty close to minimum so this is not such a bad fit to the to the data where for a particular value of theta zero which whatever this value is in for a particular value of theta one we get a particular H of X and this is this is not quite at the minimum is pretty close and so the sum of squares errors or some squares distances between my training examples and my hypothesis every that's the sum of squared distances right of all of these errors this is pretty close to the minimum even though it's not quite a minimum so with these figures I hope that gives you a better understanding of what values of the cost function J and how they are and how that corresponds to different hypotheses as well as how better hypotheses may correspond to points that closer to the minimum of this cost function J now of course what we really want is an efficient algorithm like your efficient piece of software for automatically finding the value of theta zero and theta one that minimizes the cost function J what we don't want to do is to you know have to write software to plot out this point and then try to manually read off we don't do that this is not a good way to do it and in fact we'll see later that when we look at more complicated examples will have higher dimensional figures with more parameters that that it turns out we'll see if you will see in maintenance cause examples where this figure you cannot really be plotted is becomes much harder to visualize and so what we want is to have software to find the value of theta 0 thing then minimizes this function and in the next video we'll start to talk about an algorithm for automatically finding that value of theta zero and theta one that minimizes the cost function J
