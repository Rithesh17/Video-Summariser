INSTRUCTOR: The next Internet of Things scenario using Packet Tracer, we'll look at what might be useful in a smart city type of situation. So if we have cars driving around, there's an old car and carbon monoxide detector to detect the exhaust gases coming out of the car. I'll activate the car by holding down ALT and clicking. There's the dirty exhaust gases. And then say this is a tunnel or a poorly ventilated area, we can put a fan in place so that ultimately whenever too many gases are detected by the CO detector, when an old car is parked in the area, the fan can be activated to blow them away and protect the health of the people in the area, clear the tunnel out, or some other similar situation. Obviously, at the moment, I'm just clicking on these they're not at all connected. We can look at that later on as to how they might connect to each other over different networks. While we're in the smart city situation, they have a street lamp here which detects light, so it will only come on when it's dark enough to be needed, and motion so it will only come on when there's a car near by. You can see as I move this car here the M lights up green showing that it's got motion detection. OK. That's a few different ways you can make use of devices such as street lamps or carbon monoxide detectors or being connected to each other via the network to make things talk to each other and provide Internet of Things type solutions automatically.
