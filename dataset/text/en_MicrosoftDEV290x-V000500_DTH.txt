>> Image processing involves using tools and code to analyze and manipulate Images. In Data Science and AI related projects, Python is the prevalent language for working with data of all kinds. So how can we use Python to work with image data? Well, here's our image which to the computer software is represented as a three-dimensional matrix of pixel values. In Python, Matplotlib is often the Ggplot2 package for dealing with data visualizations like charts and plots, but you can also use it to read write and display image files. Then there's the Python Image Library or Pill and a particular a Fork of that package known as Pillow. This package contains a library of useful Image Manipulation Functions that enable you to work with a wide range of image types. OpenCV is another well-established library for Python based Computer Vision Programming. Scikit-Image is yet another library that's particularly useful for applying statistical and mathematical functions to image data for analysis and modelling. Now, you might use some or all of these packages for various image related tasks. But at the end of the day, an image is just an array of numbers. The NumPy Library is great for working with numeric data structures. In fact, it turns out that a NumPy array is the perfect format to share image data across all of the available image processing packages, and acts like a common currency that you can use to exchange images between different libraries, so that you can use the specific functionality you need.
