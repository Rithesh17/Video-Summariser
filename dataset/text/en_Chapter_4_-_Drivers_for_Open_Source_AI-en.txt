There are thousands of open source software projects supporting the responsible development of AI. The use of open source is being driven by shared values among the open source and AI communities, values like transparency, the growing skills gap, improved security, reduced costs and pace of innovation, and access to the massive datasets needed for training algorithms. These common principles make the open source and AI communities natural collaborators.
