COEN VAN OOSTROM: Good afternoon.

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:12.630
This year is it's 20 years ago that I started in real estate.

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:15.840
And when I started in real estate, this man behind me,

00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:19.050
he was the guy in real estate.

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:22.210
And he wrote a book, The Art of the Deal.

00:00:22.210 --> 00:00:25.710
And that book was about deal making, and about making money, and making

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:26.730
buildings.

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:28.970
And to be really honest, I wanted to do that as well.

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:31.230
And to be more honest, if I would have known

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:33.860
that the guy was going in politics, I might have skipped it,

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:36.680
but that I didn't do.

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:38.430
And I started my company.

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:39.450
I started in Amsterdam.

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:43.110
And we built it, and we became quite successful.

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:46.550
We were, I guess, over the years after, one of the largest

00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:48.810
developers in Western Europe.

00:00:48.810 --> 00:00:53.940
But then 10 years later, now nine years ago, I met this guy.

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:55.420
Al Gore came to the Netherlands.

00:00:55.420 --> 00:00:58.360
Al Gore had just written his book and made his movie.

00:00:58.360 --> 00:01:00.890
And he was talking about global warming.

00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:04.019
And to be honest, I wasn't that much of a tree hugger.

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:08.640
I wasn't so much of a green knight going around to making green buildings.

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:11.580
But he wasn't invited to speak at a breakfast meeting, organized

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:13.500
by a Dutch CEO.

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:14.670
And I was there as well.

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:17.280
And I was listening to him, and he had a beautiful metaphor.

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:20.400
He was talking about the dikes breaking in the Netherlands, which

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:22.260
for Dutch people is a big thing.

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:25.240
And the dikes breaking, he said, if that would happen,

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:26.760
that's not a political thing.

00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:29.830
The people will stand shoulder to shoulder and fix it.

00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:33.794
So why is this not happening when it comes to sustainability?

00:01:33.794 --> 00:01:35.460
And there was a moment to ask questions.

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:39.000
And I raise my arm, and I said, so why are you talking to entrepreneurs?

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.510
Should you not be talking to governments, or to NGOs,

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:43.410
and they should talk about it?

00:01:43.410 --> 00:01:44.100
He said no.

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:47.520
He said, the businesses will be the drivers for change

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:51.150
because if the businesses do not make new products like cars, or like planes,

00:01:51.150 --> 00:01:54.270
or like buildings, then nothing's going to change.

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:56.360
And he looks at me, and what is it that you do?

00:01:56.360 --> 00:01:58.610
I said, well, I've got a real estate company.

00:01:58.610 --> 00:01:59.710
What can I do?

00:01:59.710 --> 00:02:04.080
And he said, did you know that 35% of carbon emissions in the world

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:05.520
come from buildings?

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:07.200
I said, no, I didn't know that.

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:10.979
He said, but even more important, did you know that from every dollar

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:13.965
we spent on solving this carbon emission problem,

00:02:13.965 --> 00:02:17.312
a dollar is best spent in the built environment.

00:02:17.312 --> 00:02:18.520
And I said, what do you mean?

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:21.480
He said, well very simple, if you build-- if you build a windmill,

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:24.586
if you build solar panels, you always need a subsidy.

00:02:24.586 --> 00:02:27.210
One day that will change, but for now, that's a real big thing.

00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:30.290
But in the building environment, if you spend a euro,

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:33.339
there's a big chance that you will make it back in five or 10 years.

00:02:33.339 --> 00:02:36.630
So it actually makes sense to invest in that sector, and you have a lot of work

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:38.020
to do.

00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:41.310
So, I got really inspired, I got back to my office,

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:43.381
and I got all my people together.

00:02:43.381 --> 00:02:45.630
Now, I have to tell you a little bit about my company.

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:48.800
My company was maybe more on the Trump side of things

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:52.910
then on the Gore side of things, to be really honest.

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:56.160
But we got some people together, and I said, we going to make green buildings.

00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:57.870
And they we're not really convinced.

00:02:57.870 --> 00:03:01.920
But one person raised his hand and said, hey, I never dare telling you,

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:04.230
but you know I studied physics, but I actually

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:06.300
am an expert in climate modeling.

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:08.260
And I used to work for Greenpeace, but nobody's

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:11.385
really interested in that story in this company, so I didn't tell you that.

00:03:11.385 --> 00:03:12.236
[CROWD LAUGHS]

00:03:12.236 --> 00:03:14.402
I go, OK, well, great to join the team.

00:03:14.402 --> 00:03:17.360
So we start to work, and it turned out to be not that difficult to make

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:18.318
a sustainable building.

00:03:18.318 --> 00:03:20.800
You just, from the beginning, have to look at that issue

00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:22.170
that you want to solve.

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:23.310
And we started to do that.

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:27.510
Now, I could also see that some people in my company were not that convinced.

00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:30.510
I was the boss so they would do it, but they're not really convinced.

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:32.790
And thought, I have to send a message.

00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:37.230
Now for a real estate guy, the most important thing for him and his life

00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:38.760
is his car.

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:41.370
People were driving BMWs, and they were very happy.

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:43.320
It's an ego thing, I guess.

00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:47.070
And what I did is, I said, OK, we have to change this,

00:03:47.070 --> 00:03:48.360
and I bought a Toyota Prius.

00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:50.647
And I came to the office in my Toyota Prius.

00:03:50.647 --> 00:03:52.980
And I said, guys we're going to sell all these old cars,

00:03:52.980 --> 00:03:55.021
and everybody's going to drive these amazing car,

00:03:55.021 --> 00:03:57.100
and we can actually see how much energy we use.

00:03:57.100 --> 00:04:00.562
And that's going to be like a metaphor for what we want to do with buildings.

00:04:00.562 --> 00:04:01.770
And they were not that happy.

00:04:01.770 --> 00:04:03.480
[CROWD LAUGHS]

00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:06.780
And one of these people, he took the car, and he went driving with it.

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:09.450
And he came back and he said, sorry Coen, I really--

00:04:09.450 --> 00:04:11.200
I just don't like it.

00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:12.311
And I became really upset.

00:04:12.311 --> 00:04:13.560
And I said, this is important.

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:14.726
We have to change the world.

00:04:14.726 --> 00:04:19.140
And what will our customers think if we come in an old fashioned car?

00:04:19.140 --> 00:04:21.060
And he said, yeah, maybe you're right.

00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:22.440
But I've got a better solution.

00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:25.620
And the better solution is let's buy Minis

00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:27.660
because the carbon emissions of a Mini is

00:04:27.660 --> 00:04:31.530
104 grams CO2 per kilometer, which is exactly the same amount

00:04:31.530 --> 00:04:33.810
as a Toyota Prius has.

00:04:33.810 --> 00:04:36.900
Why not go the cool way instead of--

00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:39.280
also an efficient way, but not so cool.

00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:42.870
And so the funny thing was all these people in the Netherlands

00:04:42.870 --> 00:04:46.080
were all very tall, and we were all in these small little Minis,

00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:48.430
but that became sort of a funny thing.

00:04:48.430 --> 00:04:50.370
So we started to do that.

00:04:50.370 --> 00:04:54.124
And the nice thing was that even students would send those letters

00:04:54.124 --> 00:04:56.040
and say, oh, we want to work for that company.

00:04:56.040 --> 00:04:58.800
But it also became a metaphor for our buildings

00:04:58.800 --> 00:05:01.170
because we figured out that if we want to make

00:05:01.170 --> 00:05:05.500
buildings attractive with low emissions, we have to make them nice as well.

00:05:05.500 --> 00:05:08.470
And the first building we made this building Las Palmas.

00:05:08.470 --> 00:05:13.090
And we actually owned a warehouse, and we redeveloped, retrofitted

00:05:13.090 --> 00:05:13.750
the warehouse.

00:05:13.750 --> 00:05:17.060
And on top, we wanted to make this UFO-shaped building.

00:05:17.060 --> 00:05:18.640
It became our home office.

00:05:18.640 --> 00:05:21.280
And all the technologies that were available around us,

00:05:21.280 --> 00:05:25.720
and that we knew from, let's say, universities and from companies

00:05:25.720 --> 00:05:29.050
we worked with, we put in this building, so solar, and wind,

00:05:29.050 --> 00:05:30.912
and all kinds of other technologies.

00:05:30.912 --> 00:05:32.620
And it became one of the more, let's say,

00:05:32.620 --> 00:05:34.995
one of the most sustainable buildings in the Netherlands.

00:05:34.995 --> 00:05:37.480
And today I wouldn't say it's the world record,

00:05:37.480 --> 00:05:41.350
but it was pretty good I had found it so good that I said to guys,

00:05:41.350 --> 00:05:44.230
this building needs to be blessed.

00:05:44.230 --> 00:05:46.014
And who else than the Pope can do that, so

00:05:46.014 --> 00:05:47.680
let's ask the Pope to open the building.

00:05:47.680 --> 00:05:48.690
[CROWD LAUGHS]

00:05:48.690 --> 00:05:53.350
And it's a pity, but we actually asked bishop in Rotterdam,

00:05:53.350 --> 00:05:58.120
and the bishop said, the Pope doesn't do buildings.

00:05:58.120 --> 00:06:00.020
And then somebody said, well, let's ask Gore.

00:06:00.020 --> 00:06:02.061
I said, well, we have-- we talked to him as well.

00:06:02.061 --> 00:06:05.417
And we decided to ask Bill Clinton, President Clinton,

00:06:05.417 --> 00:06:06.500
and he actually came over.

00:06:06.500 --> 00:06:11.560
He opened the building, and he became a big ambassador of green buildings

00:06:11.560 --> 00:06:12.920
and about this building.

00:06:12.920 --> 00:06:17.120
So, the next step for us was that we wanted to do something really special.

00:06:17.120 --> 00:06:19.030
We figured out there's so much more than we

00:06:19.030 --> 00:06:22.750
can do than what we have done so far, let's go out there.

00:06:22.750 --> 00:06:25.227
And we were lucky to have a tenant, Deloitte,

00:06:25.227 --> 00:06:27.310
that said we want to have a building in Amsterdam,

00:06:27.310 --> 00:06:29.650
and we want it to be the most sustainable building

00:06:29.650 --> 00:06:31.132
in the Netherlands.

00:06:31.132 --> 00:06:33.340
Now, the people in my company still were a little bit

00:06:33.340 --> 00:06:35.820
on the Trump side of things, so they said, of the Netherlands?

00:06:35.820 --> 00:06:37.070
The Netherland's not relevant.

00:06:37.070 --> 00:06:39.440
Let's do the most sensible building in the world.

00:06:39.440 --> 00:06:41.080
And I said, yeah, let's try that.

00:06:41.080 --> 00:06:44.912
But then the question is, of course, how do you measure sustainability?

00:06:44.912 --> 00:06:46.870
And it turns out in the world, there's a couple

00:06:46.870 --> 00:06:49.700
of models of measuring sustainability.

00:06:49.700 --> 00:06:51.580
There's a system in the US called LEED.

00:06:51.580 --> 00:06:53.770
There's a German system, a French system.

00:06:53.770 --> 00:06:57.820
But probably the most used system in the world is called BREEAM,

00:06:57.820 --> 00:06:59.910
and it's a system from the UK.

00:06:59.910 --> 00:07:04.870
And we adopted that system, and we knew there was a building in London that

00:07:04.870 --> 00:07:06.960
had a score of 96%.

00:07:06.960 --> 00:07:12.010
Theoretically you can go to 100%, but the maximum so far was 96%.

00:07:12.010 --> 00:07:14.180
And we started to work.

00:07:14.180 --> 00:07:18.430
And you must imagine, that if you want to do that, then the thing that

00:07:18.430 --> 00:07:21.340
is happening is that you have to take all the decisions you take

00:07:21.340 --> 00:07:24.550
in the development process, and everything,

00:07:24.550 --> 00:07:27.740
you have to try to be sustainable as possible and put it in a model.

00:07:27.740 --> 00:07:29.890
So if you order glass, or if you order concrete,

00:07:29.890 --> 00:07:35.320
or even if you order the car for the guy who is managing the building site,

00:07:35.320 --> 00:07:38.110
then that car has to be electrical because even that carbon

00:07:38.110 --> 00:07:40.000
emission is going to go into the model.

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:44.530
And if you want to break the world record, it's not going to work.

00:07:44.530 --> 00:07:47.310
And this is what the building looks like.

00:07:47.310 --> 00:07:48.839
Let me push it again.

00:07:48.839 --> 00:07:50.380
This is what the building looks like.

00:07:50.380 --> 00:07:53.140
And it became a beautiful building.

00:07:53.140 --> 00:07:56.020
But there was one little thing, we didn't make the 96%.

00:07:56.020 --> 00:07:57.700
We got to 95%.

00:07:57.700 --> 00:08:01.450
And the one thing missing in this model, the last couple of percentage,

00:08:01.450 --> 00:08:04.570
is that you have to have so-called innovation credits.

00:08:04.570 --> 00:08:06.460
So you need to do something that has never

00:08:06.460 --> 00:08:08.380
been done before in the building industry

00:08:08.380 --> 00:08:11.530
to get those last points in that BREEAM model.

00:08:11.530 --> 00:08:15.310
And we went to talk to Siemens, and General Electric,

00:08:15.310 --> 00:08:18.670
and start-ups in Berlin, and all kinds of other companies to see if somebody

00:08:18.670 --> 00:08:20.440
had something that we hadn't--

00:08:20.440 --> 00:08:22.060
that wasn't used before.

00:08:22.060 --> 00:08:24.610
And we ended up talking to a Dutch company called Philips,

00:08:24.610 --> 00:08:27.130
and they make LED systems.

00:08:27.130 --> 00:08:29.841
And they had a LED system.

00:08:29.841 --> 00:08:32.799
And you might say, well, LED, isn't that something that everybody uses?

00:08:32.799 --> 00:08:33.640
That's true.

00:08:33.640 --> 00:08:36.610
But they had a system where the LED doesn't

00:08:36.610 --> 00:08:42.049
get its power from a normal 230-volt cable, but from an Ethernet cable.

00:08:42.049 --> 00:08:44.410
And they call it "light over Ethernet."

00:08:44.410 --> 00:08:49.220
And the great thing is that not only is the cable a lot more efficient

00:08:49.220 --> 00:08:51.700
so you save energy, which was important for our model,

00:08:51.700 --> 00:08:54.920
but the great thing is that an Ethernet cable is a two-way street.

00:08:54.920 --> 00:08:56.980
So you can get data from that little light

00:08:56.980 --> 00:08:59.420
and transport it back to a central computer.

00:08:59.420 --> 00:09:02.352
Now that point, I didn't really get to at that time.

00:09:02.352 --> 00:09:04.060
I was just happy that we got the credits.

00:09:04.060 --> 00:09:10.390
And the building became 98%, and officially the Etch in Amsterdam

00:09:10.390 --> 00:09:13.550
is now the world's most sustainable building, which is nice, right?

00:09:19.060 --> 00:09:24.280
So at the day of the opening, these people that made it,

00:09:24.280 --> 00:09:27.190
they gave me a book about big data.

00:09:27.190 --> 00:09:31.820
And I heard about big data, but I wasn't really sure what it was all about.

00:09:31.820 --> 00:09:34.390
But the sensors that you see here--

00:09:34.390 --> 00:09:38.750
and we have 32,000 of those sensors in that building,

00:09:38.750 --> 00:09:41.080
they measure all kinds of information.

00:09:41.080 --> 00:09:44.000
Suddenly we can connect to your smartphone,

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:46.870
and we know exactly who is where in the building.

00:09:46.870 --> 00:09:48.850
Now you might say, I don't really want people

00:09:48.850 --> 00:09:50.500
to know where I am in the building.

00:09:50.500 --> 00:09:53.260
But for a building manager, in the old days,

00:09:53.260 --> 00:09:57.910
everybody would have his own desk, and we all know that roughly 30% to 40%

00:09:57.910 --> 00:10:00.097
of desks in a building are not being used.

00:10:00.097 --> 00:10:02.930
I'm not talking about the weekends, I'm not talking about the night,

00:10:02.930 --> 00:10:07.220
but within working hours, they're not being used for so many hours.

00:10:07.220 --> 00:10:11.067
And so if the building manager knows exactly who you are and where you are,

00:10:11.067 --> 00:10:13.150
you can actually tell the computer in the morning,

00:10:13.150 --> 00:10:15.980
you say, hey, I'm going to be working from home till 11:00.

00:10:15.980 --> 00:10:18.847
From 11:00 to 2:00, I have meetings, well, I need a meeting room.

00:10:18.847 --> 00:10:21.680
And then in the late afternoon what I want to do is read a contract,

00:10:21.680 --> 00:10:23.150
so I need a quiet place.

00:10:23.150 --> 00:10:26.250
And the building can then adapt to what you're doing.

00:10:26.250 --> 00:10:28.190
Now, if a lot of people started doing that,

00:10:28.190 --> 00:10:33.210
then the total amount of space that you save by doing that is 30%.

00:10:33.210 --> 00:10:34.972
Compare that to what AirBnB is doing.

00:10:34.972 --> 00:10:36.680
AirBnB is basically doing the same thing.

00:10:36.680 --> 00:10:40.250
They use the inefficiencies that are around real estate,

00:10:40.250 --> 00:10:42.500
and that we all know, and that is difficult to solve.

00:10:42.500 --> 00:10:44.730
But information will solve that.

00:10:44.730 --> 00:10:47.332
But then we found out that if you go in this whole world

00:10:47.332 --> 00:10:49.040
of the Internet of Things, that there are

00:10:49.040 --> 00:10:51.680
so many more things that you can do.

00:10:51.680 --> 00:10:54.774
We have a cleaning company working for us.

00:10:54.774 --> 00:10:57.940
And the cleaning company, the people working there, they have a little iPad.

00:10:57.940 --> 00:11:02.840
And on their iPad, they can see exactly how often a toilet has been used.

00:11:02.840 --> 00:11:06.020
They have a heat map where you can see if a floor has been used

00:11:06.020 --> 00:11:08.330
or not, and whether that has to be cleaned.

00:11:08.330 --> 00:11:10.080
Now in the old days, cleaning of a toilet

00:11:10.080 --> 00:11:13.050
would happened typically at the end of the day.

00:11:13.050 --> 00:11:16.430
But we all know that it's actually found that if the toilet has been used for,

00:11:16.430 --> 00:11:18.650
let's say, 30 times a day, that it gets cleaned.

00:11:18.650 --> 00:11:20.810
Now that is now possible based upon the information

00:11:20.810 --> 00:11:22.460
that comes out of the building.

00:11:22.460 --> 00:11:26.600
A whole different topic is the whole health in a building.

00:11:26.600 --> 00:11:32.360
Its sort of weird that we are all OK with a building being in such a fashion

00:11:32.360 --> 00:11:35.180
that we come in the morning at 9 o'clock, we leave at 5:00,

00:11:35.180 --> 00:11:37.820
and at 5:00 we feel less healthy than when we came in.

00:11:37.820 --> 00:11:40.280
The air quality is just not really great.

00:11:40.280 --> 00:11:42.740
Now if you have 32,000 sensors in a building,

00:11:42.740 --> 00:11:46.354
it's very easy to solve because you can, per floor or per square meter

00:11:46.354 --> 00:11:48.770
see are people working here, or are they not working here?

00:11:48.770 --> 00:11:51.630
Let's make sure that the air is going to the right places.

00:11:51.630 --> 00:11:54.500
Let's make sure that if the windows need to be opened or not opened,

00:11:54.500 --> 00:11:56.310
all these things can be done automatically.

00:11:56.310 --> 00:11:59.000
And it's going to be a huge game changer.

00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:01.049
Now this is just a start.

00:12:01.049 --> 00:12:02.840
And the next phase is going to be even more

00:12:02.840 --> 00:12:07.850
important because what happens if this is not happening on just one building.

00:12:07.850 --> 00:12:11.210
What happens if we do that over a whole city?

00:12:11.210 --> 00:12:12.950
Cities can be connected as well.

00:12:12.950 --> 00:12:16.340
And what we see today is that a building like the Etch

00:12:16.340 --> 00:12:19.760
is producing probably 10% more energy than it's using.

00:12:19.760 --> 00:12:23.940
But that energy that is left over is then going back to the grid.

00:12:23.940 --> 00:12:27.230
But this grid was built in the '70s, and is not an amazing grid.

00:12:27.230 --> 00:12:30.020
Now, if we would have the smart grid, then the building next to it

00:12:30.020 --> 00:12:36.590
can almost have a 100% efficiency in using that same energy that

00:12:36.590 --> 00:12:38.246
was used by the other building.

00:12:38.246 --> 00:12:39.870
But there are a lot more possibilities.

00:12:39.870 --> 00:12:42.560
one other possibility could be that if the building knows

00:12:42.560 --> 00:12:45.590
that there's a lot of meetings ending at 5 o'clock in the afternoon,

00:12:45.590 --> 00:12:51.270
that there's a high likelihood of a lot of Ubers being collected as well.

00:12:51.270 --> 00:12:53.579
And then with big data, the Uber people already

00:12:53.579 --> 00:12:55.370
know that that is going to happen, and they

00:12:55.370 --> 00:12:57.800
can be in front of the building instead of 10 minutes

00:12:57.800 --> 00:13:02.960
or 15 minutes later, so endless possibilities in a connected city.

00:13:02.960 --> 00:13:04.220
Has that been done before?

00:13:04.220 --> 00:13:05.000
Yes.

00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:07.250
This is a building that my company made in Rotterdam,

00:13:07.250 --> 00:13:09.080
and it's called the Vertical City.

00:13:09.080 --> 00:13:12.080
And within the Vertical City, we already experimented

00:13:12.080 --> 00:13:15.920
with having apartments, hotel, offices in one building.

00:13:15.920 --> 00:13:22.140
And we see that we can connect all these different functions in a building.

00:13:22.140 --> 00:13:23.020
this is Berlin.

00:13:23.020 --> 00:13:27.290
And this is maybe the difficult part of my story.

00:13:27.290 --> 00:13:30.820
Why is it that all these buildings that you see in this picture

00:13:30.820 --> 00:13:33.340
are actually not sustainable?

00:13:33.340 --> 00:13:36.250
New buildings, relatively easy to solve.

00:13:36.250 --> 00:13:38.710
Old buildings, a lot of work has to be done.

00:13:38.710 --> 00:13:41.230
Now basically the message I have here today

00:13:41.230 --> 00:13:45.820
is that the new technology and the big data possibilities that we have today

00:13:45.820 --> 00:13:50.560
allow us to change these existing buildings also into smart buildings.

00:13:50.560 --> 00:13:53.300
We just have to do a lot of work on it.

00:13:53.300 --> 00:13:56.230
And we need real estate people and the city

00:13:56.230 --> 00:14:00.160
to work together to make that happen.

00:14:00.160 --> 00:14:04.420
I started my talk to speak about Donald Trump and his Art Of The Deal.

00:14:04.420 --> 00:14:06.010
It was a little bit of a joke.

00:14:06.010 --> 00:14:08.890
But there's also something serious.

00:14:08.890 --> 00:14:14.470
Technology is not the problem to make our cities carbon neutral.

00:14:14.470 --> 00:14:15.860
What we need is a deal.

00:14:15.860 --> 00:14:19.219
And I think somebody and some of you should write a book,

00:14:19.219 --> 00:14:21.010
and it's got to be not the Art Of The Deal,

00:14:21.010 --> 00:14:23.260
but it's going to be the "Art Of The Climate Deal"

00:14:23.260 --> 00:14:27.820
because we need some sort of deal between the owners of real estate

00:14:27.820 --> 00:14:31.450
and the people who are governing our cities or our countries

00:14:31.450 --> 00:14:35.500
to make sure that a lot of action is taken.

00:14:35.500 --> 00:14:38.710
We have the obligation, and we can do it,

00:14:38.710 --> 00:14:43.000
to step in and make all these buildings and these 35% of carbon emissions

00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:44.980
coming from buildings going away.

00:14:44.980 --> 00:14:45.760
Thank you.

00:14:45.760 --> 00:14:49.710
[APPLAUSE]
