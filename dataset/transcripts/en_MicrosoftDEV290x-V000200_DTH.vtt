00:00:00.710 --> 00:00:03.780
>> Edge Detection is a technique that uses

00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:06.780
filters to find abrupt changes of pixel values,

00:00:06.780 --> 00:00:08.280
which often indicate the boundaries of

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:10.410
shapes or objects in the image.

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:13.830
To begin, we convert color images to grayscale,

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:16.950
so that we're only dealing with a single channel of pixels.

00:00:16.950 --> 00:00:21.105
Then, we apply particular type of filter called a Sobel Filter,

00:00:21.105 --> 00:00:23.610
after one of its inventors, Irwin Sobel,

00:00:23.610 --> 00:00:25.470
along with his colleague, Gary Feldman,

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:26.820
conceived of the idea of using

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:30.375
a three-by-three filter to find gradients in images.

00:00:30.375 --> 00:00:34.080
The technique is performed in two stages.

00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:36.690
First, this kernel is

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:39.755
applied to find the horizontal gradient for each pixel,

00:00:39.755 --> 00:00:41.645
let's call that Gx.

00:00:41.645 --> 00:00:45.860
Then, this kernel is applied to detect the vertical gradients,

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:48.030
which we'll call Gy.

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:51.440
Then, we just add the squares of the x and

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:54.230
y gradient values calculated for each pixel,

00:00:54.230 --> 00:00:55.940
and take the square root to determine

00:00:55.940 --> 00:00:58.010
the length of the vector described by the pixels.

00:00:58.010 --> 00:00:59.540
Then, we can calculate

00:00:59.540 --> 00:01:02.545
the inverse tangent of those values to determine its angle.

00:01:02.545 --> 00:01:06.400
That will reveal the edges in the image.
