INSTRUCTOR: The next Internet of Things scenario using Packet Tracer,

00:00:07.090 --> 00:00:16.110
we'll look at what might be useful in a smart city type of situation.

00:00:16.110 --> 00:00:22.120
So if we have cars driving around, there's

00:00:22.120 --> 00:00:33.600
an old car and carbon monoxide detector to detect the exhaust gases coming out

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:34.545
of the car.

00:00:34.545 --> 00:00:38.210
I'll activate the car by holding down ALT and clicking.

00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:39.615
There's the dirty exhaust gases.

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:48.890
And then say this is a tunnel or a poorly ventilated area, we

00:00:48.890 --> 00:00:56.720
can put a fan in place so that ultimately whenever too many gases are

00:00:56.720 --> 00:01:01.550
detected by the CO detector, when an old car is parked in the area,

00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:07.940
the fan can be activated to blow them away and protect

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:11.430
the health of the people in the area, clear the tunnel out,

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:13.949
or some other similar situation.

00:01:13.949 --> 00:01:15.740
Obviously, at the moment, I'm just clicking

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:18.600
on these they're not at all connected.

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:21.440
We can look at that later on as to how they might connect

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:25.330
to each other over different networks.

00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:28.120
While we're in the smart city situation, they

00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:32.530
have a street lamp here which detects light,

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:36.160
so it will only come on when it's dark enough to be needed,

00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:40.500
and motion so it will only come on when there's a car near by.

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:44.025
You can see as I move this car here the M lights up green

00:01:44.025 --> 00:01:46.362
showing that it's got motion detection.

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:50.950
OK.

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:55.270
That's a few different ways you can make use

00:01:55.270 --> 00:02:02.270
of devices such as street lamps or carbon monoxide detectors

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:05.110
or being connected to each other via the network

00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:10.660
to make things talk to each other and provide Internet of Things type

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:13.760
solutions automatically.
