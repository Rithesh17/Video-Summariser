IAN HOWARD: How do you actually know when things need maintaining?

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:10.530
You either work on a time-schedule basis--

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:15.240
but if you try to save money and try to do maintenance smarter, then

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:20.340
really what you should be doing is on a predictive-condition monitoring basis.

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:24.030
And so that requires the use of sensors--

00:00:24.030 --> 00:00:29.250
sensors that actually measure the behavior of the equipment--

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:30.720
can be vibration sensors--

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:33.570
can be pressure-- can be strain gauges--

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:36.275
can be sound microphone sensors.

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:42.810
So these sensors, traditionally, are very expensive,

00:00:42.810 --> 00:00:46.830
but now you can get really quite cheap sensors.

00:00:46.830 --> 00:00:50.190
And as far as The Internet of Things goes, what you really want to do

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:56.090
is to have those sensors embedded in the equipment with its own power supply

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:59.130
or battery supply or renewable energy--

00:00:59.130 --> 00:01:02.340
energy harvesting supply, and then have some means

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:05.450
of digitizing that signature--

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:08.880
whether it's pressure or strain or accelerometer--

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:13.620
acceleration-- and then to be able to communicate that sensor

00:01:13.620 --> 00:01:18.600
information to the web.

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:20.880
That's really where the Internet of Things comes in.

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:24.690
So I have here an example of a sensor that we put together

00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:26.440
more than 15 years ago.

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:31.050
And this was designed to fit onto large rotating equipment.

00:01:31.050 --> 00:01:35.250
And it has inbuilt in there a MEMS transducer, which

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:39.150
measures the acceleration, and also has a thermometer to measure

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:41.470
the temperature of the device.

00:01:41.470 --> 00:01:45.300
So when we developed this, we realized that okay the concept really

00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:50.970
would be to embed these into remote machines

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:54.700
and often in places that are not very accessible.

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:58.170
So you really don't want to have these battery powered

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:01.710
and then every three months have to actually replace the batteries.

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:06.090
So that brought us into the research topic of energy harvesting.

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:09.389
And there are many different types of energy

00:02:09.389 --> 00:02:11.940
we can extract from the environment--

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:16.140
for example, solar or wind energy.

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:18.330
But we've been working-- because we're looking

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:23.190
at vibration-- we've been working on energy harvesting from the vibration

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:24.450
environment.

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:29.220
And there are different techniques for extracting energy,

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:33.540
but we've been looking particularly at the piezoelectric energy harvesting.

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:36.720
So I've got an example here of a piezoelectric beam

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:38.220
that can be used for that.

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:41.970
Here is a miniature piezoelectric beam.

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:45.630
And it would be clamped to the machine.

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:52.300
So it's base-excited vibration, and this beam then vibrates back and forwards.

00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:56.450
So what we find is per meter per second squared--

00:02:56.450 --> 00:03:03.660
or per g-- you can extract fractions of a milliwatt of energy

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:07.780
from these devices if they're operating at resonance.

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:10.820
Now a fraction of a milliwatt might not sound very much.

00:03:10.820 --> 00:03:16.050
But actually, because it's generating power continuously,

00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:20.460
over the days, weeks, and months, you accumulate a lot of energy.

00:03:20.460 --> 00:03:27.600
And so, then, you can couple that with smart supercapacitors

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:34.230
or other recharging devices to recharge your batteries and so on, which

00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:36.720
gives you enough energy-- enough power to be

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:41.870
able to communicate that information from the sensor-- from the smart sensor

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:44.170
to the internet or to the web.

00:03:44.170 --> 00:03:48.570
So there's a vast array of applications now

00:03:48.570 --> 00:03:53.090
in industry for these kinds of devices.
