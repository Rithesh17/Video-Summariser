00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:04.380
we previously defined the cost function

00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:06.600
J in this video I want to tell you about

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:09.630
an algorithm called gradient descent for

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:11.610
minimizing the cost function J it turns

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:14.400
out gradient descent is a more general

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:16.199
algorithm and is used not only in linear

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:18.420
regression is actually used all over the

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:20.189
place in machine learning and later in

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:22.470
the class we'll use gradient descent to

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:24.630
minimize other functions as well not

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:27.210
just the cost function J for linear

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:28.590
regression so in this video I'm going to

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:31.619
talk about gradient descent for

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:33.690
minimizing some arbitrary function J and

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:36.120
then in later videos we'll take those

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:38.160
algorithm and apply it specifically to

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:42.750
the cost function J that we had defined

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:44.910
for linear regression so here's the

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:47.520
problem setup going to assume that we

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:49.890
have some function J of theta 0 comma

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:51.480
theta 1 maybe as a cost function from

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:53.910
linear regression maybe it's some other

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:55.710
function we want to minimize and we want

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:57.780
to come over now algorithm for

00:00:55.710 --> 00:01:01.140
minimizing that as a function of j of

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:03.449
theta0 theta1 just as an aside it turns

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:05.880
out that gradient descent actually

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:07.920
applies to more general functions so

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:10.680
imagine if you have a function that's a

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:14.070
function of j OS theta 0 theta 1 theta 2

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:17.490
up to say something that N and you want

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:21.330
to minimize theta 0 you minimize over

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:24.689
theta0 up to theta n of this J of theta

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:26.430
0 up to theta n it turns out gradient

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:28.680
descent is an algorithm for solving of

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:31.110
this more general problem but for the

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:33.210
sake of brevity on for the sake of you

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:34.979
know succinct ins of notation I'm just

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:37.290
going to pretend I have only two

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:39.930
parameters throughout the rest of this

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:41.970
video here's the idea for gradients then

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:45.090
what we're going to do is we're going to

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:47.579
start off with some initial guesses for

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:49.320
theta 0 and theta 1 doesn't really

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:52.770
matter what they are but a common choice

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:55.170
will be we set theta 0 to state 0 and

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:57.390
set theta 1 to 0 just initialize them to

00:01:55.170 --> 00:02:00.270
0 what we're going to do in gradient

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:02.640
descent is we'll keep changing theta 0

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:05.729
and say the 1 a little bit they try to

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:07.740
reduce J of theta 0 theta 1 until

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:09.030
hopefully we wind up at a minimum or

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:12.430
maybe a local

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:15.099
so let's see what let's see in pictures

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:17.049
what gradient descent does let's say you

00:02:15.099 --> 00:02:19.659
try to minimize this function so notice

00:02:17.049 --> 00:02:21.579
the axes this is a theta 0 theta 1 on

00:02:19.659 --> 00:02:23.650
the horizontal axis and J is the

00:02:21.579 --> 00:02:26.739
vertical axis and so the height of the

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:28.719
surface shows J and we want to minimize

00:02:26.739 --> 00:02:31.629
this function so we're going to start

00:02:28.719 --> 00:02:34.359
off with theta 0 theta 1 at some point

00:02:31.629 --> 00:02:36.939
so imagine making some value for theta 0

00:02:34.359 --> 00:02:39.189
theta 1 and that corresponds to starting

00:02:36.939 --> 00:02:40.989
at some points on the surface of this

00:02:39.189 --> 00:02:42.849
function okay so whatever value of theta

00:02:40.989 --> 00:02:45.250
0 theta 1 gives you some point here

00:02:42.849 --> 00:02:46.900
I didn't initialize them to 0 0 but you

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:50.379
know sometimes you neutralize it to

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:53.650
other values as well now I want you to

00:02:50.379 --> 00:02:55.900
imagine that this figure shows a hole

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:58.930
imagine this is like the landscape of

00:02:55.900 --> 00:03:01.450
some draw c-pop with you know two Hills

00:02:58.930 --> 00:03:03.730
like so and I want you to imagine that

00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:05.709
you are physically standing at that

00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:08.439
point on the hill right on this little

00:03:05.709 --> 00:03:09.879
red node on your Park in gradient

00:03:08.439 --> 00:03:12.699
descent what we're going to do is we're

00:03:09.879 --> 00:03:15.459
going to spin 360 degrees around just

00:03:12.699 --> 00:03:17.470
look all around us and also if I were to

00:03:15.459 --> 00:03:20.709
take a little baby step in some

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:23.470
direction and I want to go downhill as

00:03:20.709 --> 00:03:25.389
quickly as possible what direction do I

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:26.979
take that little baby step in if I want

00:03:25.389 --> 00:03:28.930
to go down if I sort of want to

00:03:26.979 --> 00:03:32.049
physically walk down this hill as

00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:33.129
rapidly as possible turns out that if

00:03:32.049 --> 00:03:35.709
you're standing at that point on the

00:03:33.129 --> 00:03:37.000
hill you look all around you find that

00:03:35.709 --> 00:03:39.759
the best direction to take a little

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:43.120
little step downhill is roughly that

00:03:39.759 --> 00:03:45.250
direction okay and now you have this new

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:47.590
point on your hill you're going to again

00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:49.870
look all around and then say what

00:03:47.590 --> 00:03:52.479
direction should I step in order to take

00:03:49.870 --> 00:03:55.060
a little baby step downhill and if you

00:03:52.479 --> 00:03:57.699
do that and take another step you take a

00:03:55.060 --> 00:03:59.349
step in that direction and then you keep

00:03:57.699 --> 00:04:01.299
going you know from this new point you

00:03:59.349 --> 00:04:03.280
look around taking decide what direction

00:04:01.299 --> 00:04:06.129
will take you down hill most quickly

00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:09.340
take another step another step and so on

00:04:06.129 --> 00:04:12.639
until you converge to this a local

00:04:09.340 --> 00:04:15.819
minimum down here here the dissenter is

00:04:12.639 --> 00:04:17.709
an interesting property this first time

00:04:15.819 --> 00:04:20.529
we ran gradient descent we were starting

00:04:17.709 --> 00:04:21.549
at this point over here right starts it

00:04:20.529 --> 00:04:24.430
at that point over here

00:04:21.549 --> 00:04:26.560
now imagine we have initialized gradient

00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:28.240
descent just a couple steps to the right

00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:29.919
imagine with a nationalized gradient

00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:32.229
descent with that points on the upper

00:04:29.919 --> 00:04:33.639
right if you were to repeat this process

00:04:32.229 --> 00:04:35.590
so stop at that point

00:04:33.639 --> 00:04:37.930
look all around take a little step in

00:04:35.590 --> 00:04:39.940
the direction of steepest descent you

00:04:37.930 --> 00:04:44.440
would do that then look around take

00:04:39.940 --> 00:04:46.199
another step and so on and if you

00:04:44.440 --> 00:04:49.120
started just a couple steps to the right

00:04:46.199 --> 00:04:52.599
gradient descent would have taken you to

00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:56.050
this second local optimum over on the

00:04:52.599 --> 00:04:57.520
right so if you have started this first

00:04:56.050 --> 00:04:59.949
point you would have wondered about this

00:04:57.520 --> 00:05:01.240
local optima but you started just a

00:04:59.949 --> 00:05:03.849
little bit slightly different location

00:05:01.240 --> 00:05:06.580
you would have wound up at a very

00:05:03.849 --> 00:05:08.740
different local optimum and this is a

00:05:06.580 --> 00:05:11.979
property of gradients in that will stay

00:05:08.740 --> 00:05:15.639
a little bit more about later so that's

00:05:11.979 --> 00:05:19.270
the intuition in pictures let's look at

00:05:15.639 --> 00:05:21.400
the map this is the definition of the

00:05:19.270 --> 00:05:25.810
gradient descent algorithm we're going

00:05:21.400 --> 00:05:28.150
to just repeat the Li do this until

00:05:25.810 --> 00:05:31.090
converging so we're going to update my

00:05:28.150 --> 00:05:33.639
parameter theta J by you know taking

00:05:31.090 --> 00:05:36.969
theta J and subtracting from it alpha at

00:05:33.639 --> 00:05:38.800
times this term over here okay so let's

00:05:36.969 --> 00:05:42.430
see a lot of details in this equation so

00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:45.279
let me unpack some of it first this

00:05:42.430 --> 00:05:48.039
notation here R colon equals going to

00:05:45.279 --> 00:05:52.330
use colon equals to denote assignment so

00:05:48.039 --> 00:05:55.569
the assignment operator so concretely if

00:05:52.330 --> 00:05:58.389
I write a colon equals B what this means

00:05:55.569 --> 00:06:01.180
is it means eel in a computer this means

00:05:58.389 --> 00:06:02.979
take the value in B and use it to

00:06:01.180 --> 00:06:04.960
overwrite whatever value is in so this

00:06:02.979 --> 00:06:07.419
means zero set a to be equal to the

00:06:04.960 --> 00:06:10.599
value of B it's its assignment and I can

00:06:07.419 --> 00:06:12.879
also do a colon equals a plus one this

00:06:10.599 --> 00:06:16.719
means take a and increase this value by

00:06:12.879 --> 00:06:19.300
one whereas in contrast if I use the

00:06:16.719 --> 00:06:25.719
equal sign then I write a equals B then

00:06:19.300 --> 00:06:28.360
this is a truth assertion okay so if I

00:06:25.719 --> 00:06:30.699
write a equals B then I'm asserting that

00:06:28.360 --> 00:06:32.589
the value of a equals to the value of B

00:06:30.699 --> 00:06:34.090
right so the left hand side that's the

00:06:32.589 --> 00:06:35.770
computer operation

00:06:34.090 --> 00:06:37.389
where you set the value of a to new

00:06:35.770 --> 00:06:39.730
value the right hand side this is

00:06:37.389 --> 00:06:41.380
asserting I'm just making a claim that

00:06:39.730 --> 00:06:44.080
the values of a and B are the same and

00:06:41.380 --> 00:06:46.540
so whereas I can write a colon equals a

00:06:44.080 --> 00:06:49.180
plus 1/10 is increment a by 1 hopefully

00:06:46.540 --> 00:06:51.639
I won't ever write a equals a plus 1

00:06:49.180 --> 00:06:53.830
because this is wrong write a and a plus

00:06:51.639 --> 00:06:56.050
1 can never be equal to the same values

00:06:53.830 --> 00:06:58.290
okay so there's the first part of the

00:06:56.050 --> 00:07:05.260
definition um

00:06:58.290 --> 00:07:09.729
this alpha here is a is a number that is

00:07:05.260 --> 00:07:12.729
called the learning rate and what alpha

00:07:09.729 --> 00:07:14.800
does is it basically controls how big a

00:07:12.729 --> 00:07:17.440
step we take downhill with creating

00:07:14.800 --> 00:07:18.820
descent so if alpha is very large then

00:07:17.440 --> 00:07:20.830
that corresponds to a very aggressive

00:07:18.820 --> 00:07:22.360
gradient descent procedure when we're

00:07:20.830 --> 00:07:24.430
trying to take huge steps downhill and

00:07:22.360 --> 00:07:27.430
if alpha is very small then we're taking

00:07:24.430 --> 00:07:29.200
little baby steps downhill and I'll come

00:07:27.430 --> 00:07:32.320
back and say more about this later about

00:07:29.200 --> 00:07:36.639
how to set alpha and so on and finally

00:07:32.320 --> 00:07:38.470
this term here that's a derivative term

00:07:36.639 --> 00:07:41.979
I don't want to talk about it right now

00:07:38.470 --> 00:07:44.260
but I will derive this derivative term

00:07:41.979 --> 00:07:46.720
and tell you exactly what this is later

00:07:44.260 --> 00:07:48.700
okay and some of you will be more

00:07:46.720 --> 00:07:50.110
familiar with calculus in others but

00:07:48.700 --> 00:07:51.820
even if you aren't familiar with

00:07:50.110 --> 00:07:53.500
calculus don't worry about it I'll tell

00:07:51.820 --> 00:07:57.849
you what you need to know about this

00:07:53.500 --> 00:07:59.550
term here now there's one more subtlety

00:07:57.849 --> 00:08:01.539
about gradient descent which is

00:07:59.550 --> 00:08:03.760
ingrained in descent we're going to

00:08:01.539 --> 00:08:05.979
update you know theta zero and theta one

00:08:03.760 --> 00:08:07.720
right so this update takes place for J

00:08:05.979 --> 00:08:11.620
equals zero and J equals ones you can

00:08:07.720 --> 00:08:14.229
update J theta zero and update theta one

00:08:11.620 --> 00:08:16.740
and the subtlety of how you implement

00:08:14.229 --> 00:08:20.620
gradient descent is for this expression

00:08:16.740 --> 00:08:28.140
right for this update equation you want

00:08:20.620 --> 00:08:33.060
to simultaneously update

00:08:28.140 --> 00:08:34.710
theta 0 and theta 1 what I mean by that

00:08:33.060 --> 00:08:36.660
is that you know in this equation we're

00:08:34.710 --> 00:08:38.670
going to update theta 0 co 2 equals

00:08:36.660 --> 00:08:40.200
theta 0 minus something and update theta

00:08:38.670 --> 00:08:43.230
1 code equals theta 1 minus something

00:08:40.200 --> 00:08:46.100
and the way to implement is is you

00:08:43.230 --> 00:08:49.800
should compute the right hand side right

00:08:46.100 --> 00:08:53.100
compute that thing for theta 0 and theta

00:08:49.800 --> 00:08:56.220
1 and then simultaneously at the same

00:08:53.100 --> 00:08:59.580
time update theta 0 and theta 1 okay so

00:08:56.220 --> 00:09:01.410
let me say what I mean by that this is a

00:08:59.580 --> 00:09:03.120
correct implementation of written

00:09:01.410 --> 00:09:06.000
meaning on simultaneous updates I'm

00:09:03.120 --> 00:09:07.530
going to set 10 0 equals at set 10 1

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:09.750
equals that so the basic computer right

00:09:07.530 --> 00:09:11.190
hand sides and then having computed the

00:09:09.750 --> 00:09:13.080
right hand sides and store them in two

00:09:11.190 --> 00:09:14.730
variables x 0 and temp 1 I'm going to

00:09:13.080 --> 00:09:16.470
year update theta 0 and theta 1

00:09:14.730 --> 00:09:19.710
simultaneously that's a correct

00:09:16.470 --> 00:09:22.050
implementation in contrast here's an

00:09:19.710 --> 00:09:25.680
incorrect implementation that does not

00:09:22.050 --> 00:09:28.820
do a simultaneous update so in this

00:09:25.680 --> 00:09:31.530
incorrect implementation we compute 10 0

00:09:28.820 --> 00:09:33.480
and then we update theta 0 let me

00:09:31.530 --> 00:09:36.330
compute tenth one and then we update 10

00:09:33.480 --> 00:09:37.620
1 and the difference between the right

00:09:36.330 --> 00:09:39.930
hand side and the left hand side

00:09:37.620 --> 00:09:42.420
implementations is that if you look down

00:09:39.930 --> 00:09:44.820
here you look at this step if by this

00:09:42.420 --> 00:09:48.360
time you've already updated theta zero

00:09:44.820 --> 00:09:50.700
then you would be using the new value of

00:09:48.360 --> 00:09:53.250
theta 0 you know to compute this

00:09:50.700 --> 00:09:56.880
derivative term and so this gives you a

00:09:53.250 --> 00:09:59.250
different value of 10 1 then the left

00:09:56.880 --> 00:10:01.470
hand side right because you've now

00:09:59.250 --> 00:10:03.600
plugged in the new value of theta 0 into

00:10:01.470 --> 00:10:04.920
this equation and so this on the right

00:10:03.600 --> 00:10:07.740
hand side is not a correct

00:10:04.920 --> 00:10:09.390
implementation of gradient descent ok so

00:10:07.740 --> 00:10:11.610
I don't want to say why you need to do

00:10:09.390 --> 00:10:14.580
the simultaneous updates so it turns out

00:10:11.610 --> 00:10:16.830
that you know the way gradient descent

00:10:14.580 --> 00:10:18.900
is usually implemented we say more but

00:10:16.830 --> 00:10:20.820
later it actually turns out to be more

00:10:18.900 --> 00:10:22.770
natural to implement the simultaneous

00:10:20.820 --> 00:10:24.420
updates and when people talk about

00:10:22.770 --> 00:10:26.940
gradient descent they always mean

00:10:24.420 --> 00:10:29.310
simultaneous update if you implement the

00:10:26.940 --> 00:10:31.590
non simultaneous update it turns out it

00:10:29.310 --> 00:10:33.240
will probably work anyway but this is

00:10:31.590 --> 00:10:35.160
this album on the right is not what

00:10:33.240 --> 00:10:36.720
people refer to as free ascent and this

00:10:35.160 --> 00:10:39.000
is some other algorithm with different

00:10:36.720 --> 00:10:40.019
properties and for various reasons this

00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:41.639
behaves

00:10:40.019 --> 00:10:43.379
can behave and slightly stranger ways

00:10:41.639 --> 00:10:45.300
and so you know what you should do is

00:10:43.379 --> 00:10:48.959
really implement the simultaneous update

00:10:45.300 --> 00:10:50.100
of gradient descent so that's the

00:10:48.959 --> 00:10:52.949
outline of the gradient descent

00:10:50.100 --> 00:10:55.679
algorithm in the next video we're going

00:10:52.949 --> 00:10:57.299
to go into the details of the derivative

00:10:55.679 --> 00:10:59.610
term which I wrote I'll back didn't

00:10:57.299 --> 00:11:01.470
really define and if you take the

00:10:59.610 --> 00:11:03.269
calculus class before and if you're

00:11:01.470 --> 00:11:05.129
familiar with partial derivatives and

00:11:03.269 --> 00:11:09.299
derivatives it turns out that's exactly

00:11:05.129 --> 00:11:11.160
what that derivative term is but in case

00:11:09.299 --> 00:11:12.809
you aren't familiar of calculus don't

00:11:11.160 --> 00:11:14.549
worry about it the next video will give

00:11:12.809 --> 00:11:16.589
you all the intuitions and will tell you

00:11:14.549 --> 00:11:18.540
everything you need to know to compute

00:11:16.589 --> 00:11:20.279
that derivative term even if you haven't

00:11:18.540 --> 00:11:23.939
seen calculus or even you haven't seen

00:11:20.279 --> 00:11:25.829
partial derivatives before and with that

00:11:23.939 --> 00:11:27.600
with the next video hopefully we'll

00:11:25.829 --> 00:11:31.249
really give you all the intuitions you

00:11:27.600 --> 00:11:31.249
need to apply gradient descent
