00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:14.730
I remember coming to Sydney thirteen years ago.

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:18.289
The entryway from the north into

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:18.289
Sydney is through this great bridge.

00:00:20.870 --> 00:00:26.060
It was built to a great engineering

00:00:23.690 --> 00:00:27.310
standard but it still needs to be

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:31.350
monitored and looked at.

00:00:27.310 --> 00:00:31.350

00:00:31.690 --> 00:00:36.490
What we've seen over the years is an

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:38.410
increase in volume of vehicles. The weight of

00:00:36.490 --> 00:00:39.730
trucks towing lots of freight and what

00:00:38.410 --> 00:00:41.740
we're trying to do is understand how the

00:00:39.730 --> 00:00:43.090
bridge responds to different loading and

00:00:41.740 --> 00:00:44.170
making sure that that bridge will be

00:00:43.090 --> 00:00:48.270
able to accommodate those changes

00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:48.270
To conditions and loading uses over time.

00:00:49.329 --> 00:00:52.989
Rhodes Maritime Services came to us

00:00:51.309 --> 00:00:55.030
and said how can we manage Sydney

00:00:52.989 --> 00:00:56.410
Harbour Bridge? Currently we send

00:00:55.030 --> 00:00:57.850
inspectors, he said, but it would be really

00:00:56.410 --> 00:00:59.590
good to have some sensors or some sort of

00:00:57.850 --> 00:01:01.269
technology to help us get an early

00:00:59.590 --> 00:01:03.340
warning if some maintenance is needed. And

00:01:01.269 --> 00:01:04.629
we ended up with the technology where we

00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:06.640
could basically give the bridge oa voice.

00:01:04.629 --> 00:01:10.570
The bridge could tell the asset manager

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:12.130
when the bridge needs attention. We have

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:14.290
this fiber-optic network going the

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:16.270
length of the bridge with 3200 sensors

00:01:14.290 --> 00:01:17.800
underneath the bridge. As vehicles

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:19.570
travel over the bridge we're measuring

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:22.020
vibrations and then measuring the response

00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:24.610
of the structure to those vibrations.

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:27.039
With so much traffic going over it and wind

00:01:24.610 --> 00:01:28.630
and other things going on so to extract

00:01:27.039 --> 00:01:30.880
some meaningful information we use

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:33.070
machine learning. It's a set of smart

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:35.140
algorithms, can take the raw data and

00:01:33.070 --> 00:01:38.860
then tell you the performance of the

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:40.600
bridge. It's going to help understand the

00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:41.979
ability of that asset to cope in

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:46.780
different conditions and really maximize

00:01:41.979 --> 00:01:48.580
the productivity and efficiency. Really

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:50.740
brings together distributed sensors,

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:52.920
communication networking technologies,

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:56.490
smart algorithms and data visualization

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:59.490
suited to our customers needs.

00:01:56.490 --> 00:02:01.590
The next steps for us at Data 61 is to work

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:04.200
with Cisco through innovation central

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:06.420
taking all of our learning from the Sydney

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:09.600
Harbour Bridge and packaging it up in a way

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:11.640
thats scalable, can be marketed to

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:13.530
different segments and can apply to

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:15.740
different sized structures through

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:18.839
Australia and the world.

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:18.839
[Music]

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:24.110
I see a connected world, an Internet of

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:26.600
Things world and the ability to

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:27.710
connect and understand our

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:30.620
infrastructure is going to be

00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:32.280
Key to that. This technology will

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:37.020
help us do that.
