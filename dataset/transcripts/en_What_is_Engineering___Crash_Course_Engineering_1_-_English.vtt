00:00:03.100 --> 00:00:05.080
You live in a world of creations.

00:00:05.080 --> 00:00:08.210
All of the things you see around me were created
by people.

00:00:08.210 --> 00:00:13.020
The technology that’s being used to record
me, and watch me, were likewise created.

00:00:13.020 --> 00:00:19.060
And not by lone geniuses, but by whole teams –
sometimes entire generations – of clever designers.

00:00:19.060 --> 00:00:21.020
Those designers were engineers.

00:00:21.030 --> 00:00:23.970
And engineers are, when it comes right down
to it, creators.

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:31.640
The word “engineering” itself comes from
the Latin ingenium, meaning “cleverness”, and
ingeniare, meaning “to design or devise”.

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:37.280
And that makes sense, since you have to be
clever if you’re going to solve the problems
that engineers face every day.

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:40.940
Now, you might think of engineering as a kind
of science – and that’s not wrong.

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:48.740
But it’s more useful to think of science as a tool, a
tool that engineers use – along with mathematics –
to perform their unique duties.

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:53.380
Throughout this course, we’re going to show you
just what you can accomplish through engineering.

00:00:53.380 --> 00:00:59.120
Math is at the core of engineering, but what’s
more important are the ideas and the applications.

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:02.640
They help us understand how we use math to
solve problems.

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:08.180
So we’ll be teaching you some math, but
also the concepts that those equations explain,
in their own way.

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:15.060
We’ll survey what we’ve already achieved,
explore what we’re still discovering, and dream
about what we hope to make possible.

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:18.940
And we’ll show you the ideas you can use
to engineer great things!

00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:23.320
We want you to be inspired and as interested
in engineering as we are.

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:25.400
That’s what this course is all about.

00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:29.520
I’m Dr. Shini Somara and this is Crash Course
Engineering.

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:39.440
[Theme Music]

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:45.000
Imagine you’re walking through town,
maybe on your way to class, or to the gym, or
to a meeting for work.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:49.220
And right there on the pavement you come across...a
blob. Of…something.

00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:51.360
It’s fairly large, and blue, and jiggly.

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:53.400
Pretty strange, right?
What do you do?

00:01:53.400 --> 00:02:00.400
Well, you’re a curious person, and you know a little
something about scientific inquiry, so you want to
use science to study the blob.

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:02.380
Maybe your background is in chemistry.

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:09.140
So you might analyze the blob’s molecular
structure or the chemical components in it, to try
and figure out what the blob is made of.

00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:13.920
Or maybe the blob is moving or making sounds,
and you think it might be alive.

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:18.780
So you might try to see how it responds to,
say, water or a poke with your pen.

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:22.920
Maybe you even decide to remove a sample of
it to learn about the blob’s biology.

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:27.500
You could even look at it from the perspective
of physics and see how it operates in motion.

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:30.020
Maybe this goo has some special properties.

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:34.000
Any of these responses would be approaching
the situation as a scientist.

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:37.260
You’re curious about the blob and want to
understand it.

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:38.480
That’s science.

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:46.120
Scientists ask questions about the nature of the
universe, from our expanding knowledge of space, to
the tiniest particles found in the tip of your pencil.

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:50.220
But engineers want to take the answers to
those questions and solve problems.

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:55.780
Because, in the process of designing clever things,
what engineering really does is solve problems.

00:02:55.780 --> 00:02:59.040
And the good news is, you already know how
to think like an engineer.

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:02.720
You’ve dabbled in engineering if you’ve
ever wondered what you can do with something.

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:10.140
You’ve used your engineer’s mind if you went
outside on a snowy morning and built a snowman,
after figuring out the packing properties of the snow.

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:13.600
I’m not saying you should put that on your
resume, but you do get a thumbs-up!

00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:19.620
So, from an engineering perspective, your
response to the mysterious sidewalk blob
would be a little different.

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:22.480
But it may depend on what kind of engineer
you are.

00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:26.080
Today, engineering is much broader and more
varied than it used to be.

00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:30.420
That’s because engineering originally referred
specifically to military engineering.

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:37.380
Military engineering involves designing and building
military works, along with ways of communicating and
transporting people and things.

00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:40.700
Think of catapults, trebuchets, and siege
towers.

00:03:40.700 --> 00:03:48.520
These types of war machines and military structures
have been found as far back as 11th century BCE,
by the Babylonians and Assyrians.

00:03:48.520 --> 00:03:51.580
You needed a good engineer if you want to
storm a castle.

00:03:51.580 --> 00:03:58.340
So from the perspective of this field, the
main problem that an engineer might want to
solve is simply how to destroy the blob.

00:03:58.340 --> 00:03:59.820
Or to protect yourself from it.

00:03:59.820 --> 00:04:05.320
Now, the first of the modern field of
engineering to emerge after military engineering
was civil engineering.

00:04:05.320 --> 00:04:08.500
This branch had its official start around
the 18th century.

00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:14.060
Like the name implies, civil engineering was used
for civilian purposes, rather than military ones.

00:04:14.060 --> 00:04:20.880
It focuses on building structures of all kinds,
along with highways, sanitation systems, and
even entire cities.

00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:28.540
Under this branch of engineering, we might want to
study the blob, to figure out what properties it has that
can be used to solve problems of daily civilian life.

00:04:28.540 --> 00:04:33.340
Like maybe the blob’s goo is better insulating
material than what’s currently in your house.

00:04:33.340 --> 00:04:42.160
Or maybe it turns out to be really elastic, or waterproof,
or have some other property that could make it useful
in construction, infrastructure, or urban planning.

00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:49.180
The 19th century led to an increasing focus
on the machinery industry, which gave rise to
the branch of mechanical engineering.

00:04:49.180 --> 00:04:52.840
Which I must say, as a mechanical engineer
myself, is a fine discipline!

00:04:52.840 --> 00:04:57.680
This branch focuses on machinery and mechanical
systems, from robots to engines.

00:04:57.680 --> 00:05:06.360
Thomas Savery and Thomas Newcomen, two English inventors who are credited with creating the steam engine in the early 1700s, were both mechanical engineers.

00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:13.020
And so was James Watt, the Scottish scientist
who made their design much more efficient by
recapturing the steam in the engine.

00:05:13.030 --> 00:05:16.520
The industrial revolution was led by mechanical
engineers like them.

00:05:16.520 --> 00:05:22.600
Then, electrical engineering was a natural
progression, once we were able to generate
electricity and create electronics.

00:05:22.600 --> 00:05:27.320
Dating back to the 19th century, electrical
engineering deals with devices and systems

00:05:27.320 --> 00:05:34.840
that can range anywhere from microchips and
cell phones to the giant power station generators
that help supply energy to big cities.

00:05:34.840 --> 00:05:40.060
Electrical and mechanical engineering
often come together to create some pretty
fantastic inventions.

00:05:40.060 --> 00:05:46.760
If you want a robot that can move about like we
do, you’re going to need a mechanical engineer
to set up the “skeleton” of the machine.

00:05:46.760 --> 00:05:54.020
Then, to give it a “heart” of electricity,
you’ll need an electrical engineer to provide
power to the robot with electronics.

00:05:54.020 --> 00:05:59.000
And if you want it to act like us too, you’ll
need someone skilled in computer science.

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:00.780
But engineering doesn’t stop there.

00:06:00.780 --> 00:06:04.520
Another field was founded in the late 19th
century: chemical engineering.

00:06:04.520 --> 00:06:12.200
These engineers have quite a wide focus, not
only designing and operating chemical plants that
do things like refine oil and distill alcohol.

00:06:12.200 --> 00:06:16.660
They also deal with food, medicine, the environment,
and much more.

00:06:16.660 --> 00:06:21.860
They’re involved not only with the
preservatives and artificial flavors found in
the pizza pocket you ate last night,

00:06:21.860 --> 00:06:25.920
but also with the medicine you took the
next day to help your upset stomach.

00:06:25.920 --> 00:06:33.660
Together, civil, mechanical, electrical, and
chemical engineering are often seen as the four main
branches of engineering in the modern world.

00:06:33.660 --> 00:06:36.880
But there are many more fields that specialize
even further.

00:06:36.880 --> 00:06:41.120
We have aerospace engineers building machines
that fly in the air and space;

00:06:41.120 --> 00:06:44.860
nuclear engineers harnessing the energy
released from nuclear reactions;

00:06:44.860 --> 00:06:49.460
and biomedical engineers creating medical
equipment and devices to solve clinical problems.

00:06:49.460 --> 00:06:50.640
The list goes on!

00:06:50.640 --> 00:06:54.740
And one branch that supports all of them is
industrial engineering.

00:06:54.740 --> 00:07:03.180
Engineers in this field design and optimize
the facilities, equipment, and systems that many
other engineers use to create their products.

00:07:03.180 --> 00:07:06.600
Think of them as the support class of the
engineering world.

00:07:06.600 --> 00:07:10.780
They provide the all-important groundwork
for many of our engineering advances.

00:07:10.780 --> 00:07:19.340
We’ll need some industrial engineers to help us with
our factory when we start manufacturing our cool new
products based on whatever this blob is made of.

00:07:19.340 --> 00:07:25.000
With the power of engineering at our fingertips, we’ve
already been able to do some pretty amazing things.

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:32.180
We’ve built spaceships that have sent people
to the moon and given Mars a few rovers, which are
fantastic works of engineering themselves.

00:07:32.180 --> 00:07:38.020
We’ve made artificial hearts to pump blood
through the human body and artificial limbs
to replace the ones that were lost.

00:07:38.020 --> 00:07:43.140
We’ve designed giant skyscrapers that wave
at the clouds and show the world just how
high we can reach.

00:07:43.150 --> 00:07:44.840
And we’ve only just begun!

00:07:44.840 --> 00:07:52.440
In the future, it’s very possible that we’ll
see advances like an artificial pancreas that
would effectively cure Type 1 Diabetes.

00:07:52.440 --> 00:08:00.200
And new nanotechnology that will show the
might of being small, and rockets that will finally send
people to Mars to hang out with those rovers.

00:08:00.200 --> 00:08:03.640
This and much more could all come from engineering.

00:08:03.640 --> 00:08:07.160
Maybe one day you’ll be the one to create
something truly amazing!

00:08:07.160 --> 00:08:10.820
As for the blob you found on the pavement,
I don’t know what that thing is.

00:08:10.820 --> 00:08:14.440
Maybe it’ll turn out to be a huge wad of
used chewing gum.

00:08:14.440 --> 00:08:16.220
Or maybe it’s a new lifeform.

00:08:16.220 --> 00:08:22.200
No matter what, it won’t be the first, or
last, mysterious object you’ll encounter
as a student of engineering.

00:08:22.200 --> 00:08:26.100
The world is full of strange things with great
potential for solving problems.

00:08:26.100 --> 00:08:31.220
When you use your engineering mind, everything
suddenly seems both perplexing and exciting.

00:08:31.220 --> 00:08:35.620
So, over the next forty-odd weeks, we’ll
show you how to build things. Design things.

00:08:35.620 --> 00:08:37.400
We’ll show you how to solve problems.

00:08:37.400 --> 00:08:41.720
We want you to be able to make things better
and figure out what’s next for the world.

00:08:41.720 --> 00:08:46.060
Because we all live in a world of creation,
and we want you to be a creator.

00:08:46.060 --> 00:08:50.120
Next time, we’ll continue our journey by
diving deeper into civil engineering.

00:08:50.120 --> 00:08:58.040
We’ll learn more about its history and the types
of work that civil engineers do, getting you one step
closer to being an engineering master of the universe.

00:08:58.040 --> 00:09:00.060
Thanks for watching and I’ll see you then!

00:09:00.070 --> 00:09:04.410
