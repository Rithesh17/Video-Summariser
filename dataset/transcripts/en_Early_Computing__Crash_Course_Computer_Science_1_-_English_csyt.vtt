00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:06.520
Hello world, I’m Carrie Anne, and welcome
to CrashCourse Computer Science!

00:00:06.520 --> 00:00:10.680
Over the course of this series, we’re going
to go from bits, bytes, transistors and logic

00:00:10.680 --> 00:00:14.370
gates, all the way to Operating Systems, Virtual
Reality and Robots!

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:17.849
We’re going to cover a lot, but just to
clear things up - we ARE NOT going to teach

00:00:17.849 --> 00:00:18.849
you how to program.

00:00:18.849 --> 00:00:22.980
Instead, we’re going to explore a range
of computing topics as a discipline and a

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:23.980
technology.

00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:25.640
Computers are the lifeblood of today’s world.

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:29.050
If they were to suddenly turn off, all at
once, the power grid would shut down, cars

00:00:29.050 --> 00:00:33.750
would crash, planes would fall, water treatment
plants would stop, stock markets would freeze,

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:37.350
trucks with food wouldn’t know where to
deliver, and employees wouldn’t get paid.

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:41.730
Even many non-computer objects - like DFTBA
shirts and the chair I’m sitting on – are

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:44.280
made in factories run by computers.

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:47.050
Computing really has transformed nearly every
aspect of our lives.

00:00:47.050 --> 00:00:50.489
And this isn’t the first time we’ve seen
this sort of technology-driven global change.

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:55.379
Advances in manufacturing during the Industrial
Revolution brought a new scale to human civilization

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:57.329
- in agriculture, industry and domestic life.

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:02.039
Mechanization meant superior harvests and
more food, mass produced goods, cheaper and

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:05.329
faster travel and communication, and usually
a better quality of life.

00:01:05.329 --> 00:01:09.779
And computing technology is doing the same
right now – from automated farming and medical

00:01:09.779 --> 00:01:13.990
equipment, to global telecommunications and
educational opportunities, and new frontiers

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:16.700
like Virtual Reality and Self Driving Cars.

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:21.020
We are living in a time likely to be remembered
as the Electronic Age.

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:25.859
With billions of transistors in just your
smartphones, computers can seem pretty complicated,

00:01:25.859 --> 00:01:29.950
but really, they’re just simple machines
that perform complex actions through many

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:31.320
layers of abstraction.

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:35.999
So in this series, we’re going break down
those layers, and build up from simple 1’s

00:01:35.999 --> 00:01:42.189
and 0’s, to logic units, CPUs, operating
systems, the entire internet and beyond.

00:01:42.189 --> 00:01:45.980
And don’t worry, in the same way someone
buying t-shirts on a webpage doesn’t need

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:49.989
to know how that webpage was programmed, or
the web designer doesn’t need to know how

00:01:49.989 --> 00:01:54.299
all the packets are routed, or router engineers
don’t need to know about transistor logic,

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:58.340
this series will build on previous episodes
but not be dependent on them.

00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:02.119
By the end of this series, I hope that you
can better contextualize computing’s role

00:02:02.119 --> 00:02:07.259
both in your own life and society, and how
humanity's (arguably) greatest invention is

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:10.410
just in its infancy, with its biggest impacts
yet to come.

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:14.610
But before we get into all that, we should
start at computing’s origins, because although

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:24.730
electronic computers are relatively new, the
need for computation is not.

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:27.980
INTRO

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:29.980
The earliest recognized device for computing

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:34.160
was the abacus, invented in Mesopotamia around
2500 BCE.

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:39.349
It’s essentially a hand operated calculator,
that helps add and subtract many numbers.

00:02:39.349 --> 00:02:43.240
It also stores the current state of the computation,
much like your hard drive does today.

00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:47.140
The abacus was created because, the scale
of society had become greater than what a

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:49.969
single person could keep and manipulate in
their mind.

00:02:49.969 --> 00:02:53.670
There might be thousands of people in a village
or tens of thousands of cattle.

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:57.480
There are many variants of the abacus, but
let’s look at a really basic version with

00:02:57.480 --> 00:02:59.680
each row representing a different power of
ten.

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:04.209
So each bead on the bottom row represents
a single unit, in the next row they represent

00:03:04.209 --> 00:03:06.560
10, the row above 100, and so on.

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:11.880
Let’s say we have 3 heads of cattle represented
by 3 beads on the bottom row on the right side.

00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:17.160
If we were to buy 4 more cattle we would just
slide 4 more beads to the right for a total of 7.

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:22.200
But if we were to add 5 more after the first
3 we would run out of beads, so we would slide

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:26.860
everything back to the left, slide one bead
on the second row to the right, representing

00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:30.680
ten, and then add the final 2 beads on the
bottom row for a total of 12.

00:03:30.740 --> 00:03:33.120
This is particularly useful with large numbers.

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:39.720
So if we were to add 1,251 we would just add
1 to the bottom row, 5 to the second row,

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:44.099
2 to the third row, and 1 to the fourth row
- we don’t have to add in our head and the

00:03:44.099 --> 00:03:46.000
abacus stores the total for us.

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:50.371
Over the next 4000 years, humans developed
all sorts of clever computing devices, like

00:03:50.371 --> 00:03:53.580
the astrolabe, which enabled ships to calculate
their latitude at sea.

00:03:53.580 --> 00:03:56.950
Or the slide rule, for assisting with multiplication
and division.

00:03:56.950 --> 00:04:00.870
And there are literally hundred of types of
clocks created that could be used to calculate

00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:05.720
sunrise, tides, positions of celestial bodies,
and even just the time.

00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:09.290
Each one of these devices made something that
was previously laborious to calculate much

00:04:09.290 --> 00:04:14.170
faster, easier, and often more accurate –– it
lowered the barrier to entry, and at the same

00:04:14.170 --> 00:04:17.920
time, amplified our mental abilities –– take
note, this is a theme we’re going to touch

00:04:17.920 --> 00:04:19.889
on a lot in this series.

00:04:19.889 --> 00:04:24.151
As early computer pioneer Charles Babbage
said: “At each increase of knowledge, as

00:04:24.151 --> 00:04:28.710
well as on the contrivance of every new tool,
human labour becomes abridged.”

00:04:28.710 --> 00:04:31.150
However, none of these devices were called
“computers”.

00:04:31.150 --> 00:04:36.199
The earliest documented use of the word “computer”
is from 1613, in a book by Richard Braithwait.

00:04:36.199 --> 00:04:38.880
And it wasn’t a machine at all - it was
a job title.

00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:41.680
Braithwait said,
“I have read the truest computer of times,

00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:46.419
and the best arithmetician that ever breathed,
and he reduceth thy dayes into a short number”.

00:04:46.419 --> 00:04:51.120
In those days, computer was a person who did
calculations, sometimes with the help of machines,

00:04:51.120 --> 00:04:52.120
but often not.

00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:56.150
This job title persisted until the late 1800s,
when the meaning of computer started shifting

00:04:56.150 --> 00:04:57.750
to refer to devices.

00:04:57.750 --> 00:05:02.020
Notable among these devices was the Step Reckoner,
built by German polymath Gottfried Leibniz

00:05:02.020 --> 00:05:03.360
in 1694.

00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:08.319
Leibniz said “... it is beneath the dignity
of excellent men to waste their time in calculation

00:05:08.319 --> 00:05:11.789
when any peasant could do the work just as
accurately with the aid of a machine.”

00:05:11.789 --> 00:05:15.540
It worked kind of like the odometer in your
car, which is really just a machine for adding

00:05:15.540 --> 00:05:17.349
up the number of miles your car has driven.

00:05:17.349 --> 00:05:21.430
The device had a series of gears that turned;
each gear had ten teeth, to represent the

00:05:21.430 --> 00:05:22.860
digits from 0 to 9.

00:05:22.860 --> 00:05:27.720
Whenever a gear bypassed nine, it rotated
back to 0 and advanced the adjacent gear by one tooth.

00:05:27.860 --> 00:05:31.160
Kind of like when hitting 10 on
that basic abacus.

00:05:31.169 --> 00:05:33.470
This worked in reverse when doing subtraction,
too.

00:05:33.470 --> 00:05:37.260
With some clever mechanical tricks, the Step
Reckoner was also able to multiply and divide

00:05:37.260 --> 00:05:38.400
numbers.

00:05:38.420 --> 00:05:42.260
Multiplications and divisions are really just
many additions and subtractions.

00:05:42.260 --> 00:05:47.720
For example, if we want to divide 17 by 5,
we just subtract 5, then 5, then 5 again,

00:05:47.720 --> 00:05:52.910
and then we can’t subtract any more 5’s…
so we know 5 goes into 17 three times, with

00:05:52.910 --> 00:05:53.910
2 left over.

00:05:53.910 --> 00:05:57.919
The Step Reckoner was able to do this in an
automated way, and was the first machine that

00:05:57.920 --> 00:06:00.020
could do all four of these operations.

00:06:00.020 --> 00:06:04.980
And this design was so successful it was used
for the next three centuries of calculator design.

00:06:04.980 --> 00:06:09.580
Unfortunately, even with mechanical calculators,
most real world problems required many steps

00:06:09.580 --> 00:06:11.800
of computation before an answer was determined.

00:06:11.819 --> 00:06:14.330
It could take hours or days to generate a
single result.

00:06:14.330 --> 00:06:17.990
Also, these hand-crafted machines were expensive,
and not accessible to most of the population.

00:06:17.990 --> 00:06:23.669
So, before 20th century, most people experienced
computing through pre-computed tables assembled

00:06:23.669 --> 00:06:26.069
by those amazing “human computers” we
talked about.

00:06:26.069 --> 00:06:30.569
So if you needed to know the square root of
8 million 6 hundred and 75 thousand 3 hundred

00:06:30.569 --> 00:06:34.710
and 9, instead of spending all day hand-cranking
your step reckoner, you could look it up in

00:06:34.710 --> 00:06:37.800
a huge book full of square root tables in
a minute or so.

00:06:37.800 --> 00:06:41.349
Speed and accuracy is particularly important
on the battlefield, and so militaries were

00:06:41.349 --> 00:06:44.139
among the first to apply computing to complex
problems.

00:06:44.139 --> 00:06:48.229
A particularly difficult problem is accurately
firing artillery shells, which by the 1800s

00:06:48.229 --> 00:06:51.450
could travel well over a kilometer (or a bit
more than half a mile).

00:06:51.450 --> 00:06:56.030
Add to this varying wind conditions, temperature,
and atmospheric pressure, and even hitting

00:06:56.030 --> 00:06:58.330
something as large as a ship was difficult.

00:06:58.330 --> 00:07:01.970
Range Tables were created that allowed gunners
to look up environmental conditions and the

00:07:01.970 --> 00:07:05.960
distance they wanted to fire, and the table
would tell them the angle to set the canon.

00:07:05.960 --> 00:07:09.650
These Range Tables worked so well, they were
used well into World War Two.

00:07:09.650 --> 00:07:13.479
The problem was, if you changed the design
of the cannon or of the shell, a whole new

00:07:13.479 --> 00:07:18.220
table had to be computed, which was massively
time consuming and inevitably led to errors.

00:07:18.220 --> 00:07:22.680
Charles Babbage acknowledged this problem
in 1822 in a paper to the Royal Astronomical

00:07:22.680 --> 00:07:27.940
Society entitled: “Note on the application
of machinery to the computation of astronomical

00:07:27.940 --> 00:07:29.090
and mathematical tables".

00:07:29.090 --> 00:07:30.849
Let’s go to the thought bubble.

00:07:30.849 --> 00:07:35.050
Charles Babbage proposed a new mechanical
device called the Difference Engine, a much

00:07:35.050 --> 00:07:38.200
more complex machine that could approximate
polynomials.

00:07:38.200 --> 00:07:43.159
Polynomials describe the relationship between
several variables - like range and air pressure,

00:07:43.159 --> 00:07:45.900
or amount of pizza Carrie Anne eats and happiness.

00:07:45.900 --> 00:07:49.659
Polynomials could also be used to approximate
logarithmic and trigonometric functions, which

00:07:49.659 --> 00:07:52.060
are a real hassle to calculate by hand.

00:07:52.060 --> 00:07:56.340
Babbage started construction in 1823, and
over the next two decades, tried to fabricate

00:07:56.340 --> 00:08:01.020
and assemble the 25,000 components, collectively
weighing around 15 tons.

00:08:01.020 --> 00:08:03.740
Unfortunately, the project was ultimately abandoned.

00:08:03.760 --> 00:08:08.860
But, in 1991, historians finished constructing
a Difference Engine based on Babbage's drawings

00:08:08.860 --> 00:08:10.509
and writings - and it worked!

00:08:10.509 --> 00:08:14.240
But more importantly, during construction
of the Difference Engine, Babbage imagined

00:08:14.240 --> 00:08:17.539
an even more complex machine - the Analytical
Engine.

00:08:17.539 --> 00:08:21.259
Unlike the Difference Engine, Step Reckoner
and all other computational devices before

00:08:21.259 --> 00:08:24.500
it - the Analytical Engine was a “general
purpose computer”.

00:08:24.500 --> 00:08:28.590
It could be used for many things, not just
one particular computation; it could be given

00:08:28.590 --> 00:08:32.650
data and run operations in sequence; it had
memory and even a primitive printer.

00:08:32.650 --> 00:08:36.720
Like the Difference Engine, it was ahead of
its time, and was never fully constructed.

00:08:36.720 --> 00:08:40.650
However, the idea of an “automatic computer”
– one that could guide itself through a

00:08:40.650 --> 00:08:45.450
series of operations automatically, was a
huge deal, and would foreshadow computer programs.

00:08:45.450 --> 00:08:50.010
English mathematician Ada Lovelace wrote hypothetical
programs for the Analytical Engine, saying,

00:08:50.010 --> 00:08:55.030
“A new, a vast, and a powerful language
is developed for the future use of analysis.”

00:08:55.030 --> 00:08:58.700
For her work, Ada is often considered the
world’s first programmer.

00:08:58.700 --> 00:09:03.690
The Analytical Engine would inspire, arguably,
the first generation of computer scientists,

00:09:03.690 --> 00:09:06.810
who incorporated many of Babbage’s ideas
in their machines.

00:09:06.810 --> 00:09:09.580
This is why Babbage is often considered the
"father of computing".

00:09:09.580 --> 00:09:10.590
Thanks Thought Bubble!

00:09:10.590 --> 00:09:14.970
So by the end of the 19th century, computing
devices were used for special purpose tasks

00:09:14.970 --> 00:09:18.880
in the sciences and engineering, but rarely
seen in business, government or domestic life.

00:09:18.880 --> 00:09:23.330
However, the US government faced a serious
problem for its 1890 census that demanded

00:09:23.330 --> 00:09:25.820
the kind of efficiency that only computers
could provide.

00:09:25.820 --> 00:09:30.090
The US Constitution requires that a census
be conducted every ten years, for the purposes

00:09:30.090 --> 00:09:33.810
of distributing federal funds, representation
in congress, and good stuff like that.

00:09:33.810 --> 00:09:38.090
And by 1880, the US population was booming,
mostly due to immigration.

00:09:38.090 --> 00:09:42.720
That census took seven years to manually compile
and by the time it was completed, it was already

00:09:42.720 --> 00:09:48.050
out of date – and it was predicted that
the 1890 census would take 13 years to compute.

00:09:48.050 --> 00:09:50.790
That’s a little problematic when it’s
required every decade!

00:09:50.790 --> 00:09:54.470
The Census bureau turned to Herman Hollerith,
who had built a tabulating machine.

00:09:54.470 --> 00:09:58.670
His machine was “electro-mechanical” – it
used traditional mechanical systems for keeping

00:09:58.670 --> 00:10:02.970
count, like Leibniz’s Step Reckoner –– but
coupled them with electrically-powered components.

00:10:02.970 --> 00:10:06.780
Hollerith’s machine used punch cards which
were paper cards with a grid of locations

00:10:06.780 --> 00:10:08.700
that can be punched out to represent data.

00:10:08.700 --> 00:10:11.910
For example, there was a series of holes for
marital status.

00:10:11.910 --> 00:10:15.830
If you were married, you would punch out the
married spot, then when the card was inserted

00:10:15.830 --> 00:10:19.620
into Hollerith’s machine, little metal pins
would come down over the card – if a spot

00:10:19.620 --> 00:10:23.670
was punched out, the pin would pass through
the hole in the paper and into a little vial

00:10:23.670 --> 00:10:25.890
of mercury, which completed the circuit.

00:10:25.890 --> 00:10:30.180
This now completed circuit powered an electric
motor, which turned a gear to add one, in

00:10:30.180 --> 00:10:32.080
this case, to the “married” total.

00:10:32.080 --> 00:10:36.180
Hollerith’s machine was roughly 10x faster
than manual tabulations, and the Census was

00:10:36.180 --> 00:10:41.130
completed in just two and a half years - saving
the census office millions of dollars.

00:10:41.130 --> 00:10:44.530
Businesses began recognizing the value of
computing, and saw its potential to boost

00:10:44.530 --> 00:10:49.700
profits by improving labor- and data-intensive
tasks, like accounting, insurance appraisals,

00:10:49.700 --> 00:10:50.950
and inventory management.

00:10:50.950 --> 00:10:55.020
To meet this demand, Hollerith founded The
Tabulating Machine Company, which later merged

00:10:55.020 --> 00:11:00.020
with other machine makers in 1924 to become
The International Business Machines Corporation

00:11:00.020 --> 00:11:02.940
or IBM - which you’ve probably heard of.

00:11:02.940 --> 00:11:07.580
These electro-mechanical “business machines”
were a huge success, transforming commerce

00:11:07.580 --> 00:11:11.710
and government, and by the mid-1900s, the
explosion in world population and the rise

00:11:11.710 --> 00:11:17.220
of globalized trade demanded even faster and
more flexible tools for processing data, setting

00:11:17.220 --> 00:11:20.620
the stage for digital computers, which we’ll
talk about next week.
