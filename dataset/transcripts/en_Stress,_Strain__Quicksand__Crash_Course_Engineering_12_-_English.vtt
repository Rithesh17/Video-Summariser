00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:06.660
No matter where we are, we’re almost always
affected by our environment.

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:09.060
Because, we’re affected by the medium that
we’re in.

00:00:09.070 --> 00:00:11.250
Usually that medium is a fluid, like air.

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:17.880
And, to understand how these fluids work, and
to be able to optimize our designs, we’re going to
need to learn about fluid mechanics.

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:24.120
Fluid mechanics explains how the air moves
around your car, how food coloring moves through
water, making all those pretty patterns.

00:00:24.120 --> 00:00:28.380
And it explains what makes quicksand act like,
well, quicksand.

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:31.020
All of which seems worth knowing, don’t
you think?

00:00:31.020 --> 00:00:41.000
[Theme Music]

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:44.240
So far, we’ve talked systems versus their
surroundings.

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:49.600
We’ve learned that mass and energy
cannot be created or destroyed, but that
they can be converted.

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:55.580
What this means for us as engineers is that,
in the real world, we can’t simply focus on
what’s going on inside our system.

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:57.700
We need to think about the outside as well.

00:00:57.720 --> 00:01:02.080
That’s because machines, buildings, even our
own bodies, are influenced by their surroundings.

00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:04.760
To see what I mean, let’s say we’re designing
a new car.

00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:10.460
We’ve already learned a good deal about
engines, so you probably have a decent idea
of what should go inside the car.

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:12.320
But what about the outside of the car?

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:17.800
While a car is moving, it’s going to interact
with the fluid that it’s moving through which
will be air in most cases.

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:19.940
Unless you’re that Tesla that got sent into space.

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:25.620
As the car interacts with the air, the two
can affect one another, and this can lead
to what we call transfer.

00:01:25.620 --> 00:01:27.200
You know what transfer is, right?

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:29.670
When something moves, or is moved, from one
place to another?

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:32.940
There can be a transfer of momentum, or a
transfer of heat.

00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:34.200
Maybe even mass.

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:41.180
But if we’re looking at moving fluids, then we’ll often
have a transfer of momentum, which can be better
understood with the help of fluid mechanics.

00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:45.400
Fluid mechanics studies how fluids respond
to the forces exerted on them.

00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:47.940
So how exactly do fluids move?

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:51.560
And how does a particle, or anything for that
matter, move within a fluid?

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:55.730
To answer these questions, we need to know
about stress, strain, and viscosity.

00:01:55.730 --> 00:02:02.600
Now, if you’ve been a student of physics for any amount
of time, I’m sure you’re familiar with stress and strain in
the colloquial sense – especially around exam time.

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:05.430
But here, of course, they mean something completely
different.

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:08.220
Suppose we have a fluid between two flat plates.

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:11.280
If we were to move the bottom plate, what
would happen to the fluid?

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:12.360
How would it move?

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:20.280
Well, at the top and bottom, where the fluid is in contact
with the surface, the individual particles of the fluid will
go through something called the no-slip condition.

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:28.680
In the no-slip condition, a fluid in motion will come
to a complete stop at a solid surface and assume
a zero velocity relative to the surface.

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:34.620
Basically, the particles of the fluid that
are touching the solid will stick to its surface,
meaning that they won’t slip.

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:43.290
Because of this, the fluid particles in contact with the
bottom plate will move with it, while the fluid particles
at the top will stay in place with the stationary plate.

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:49.120
This is all happening due to stress, the
force that’s applied to a cross-sectional area
of an object or substance.

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:54.240
If the force is normal, or perpendicular
to the surface of the object, then we have
normal stress.

00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:56.720
If it’s parallel, then we have shear stress.

00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:59.100
You thought I was gonna say “parallel stress,”
didn’t you?

00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:03.040
We can find stress by taking the applied force
and dividing it by our cross-sectional area.

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:07.260
Now, once a fluid is stressed, the degree
to which it stretches is called strain.

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:11.240
Simply put, strain is the deformation that
stress causes on a system.

00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:15.200
If the deformation causes something in a
system to become either shorter or longer,

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:20.080
then we can find its strain by taking the change
in length and dividing it by the initial length.

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:21.920
And this is called normal strain

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:28.360
But if the deformation is a change in angle between
two segments that had been perpendicular to each
other, then we have shear strain.

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:36.780
And we can find that by subtracting the change in
angle from the original angle, which will either be pi
over 2 or 90 degrees, depending on your units.

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:40.420
So all of this is what would happen if our
bottom plate was moving.

00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:45.180
But what if neither plate moved, and we had a
pump driving the flow of the fluid between them?

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:51.880
Well, the same no-slip condition would apply, so
while the fluid moved, its particles at the surface
of the two plates would stay stationary.

00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:54.740
But another thing that we’d need to take
into account is viscosity.

00:03:54.740 --> 00:04:01.460
Viscosity is essentially a measure of a fluid’s
resistance to flow, and it’s often referred to
as the thickness of a fluid.

00:04:01.460 --> 00:04:09.440
For example, water has a low viscosity, since
it flows pretty easily, while honey and other thick,
sticky fluids have a much higher viscosity.

00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:15.220
Some fluids will also thicken when exposed
to stress, like when you whisk water mixed
with cornstarch.

00:04:15.220 --> 00:04:20.560
But others will thin out when exposed to stress, like
quicksand, which is just water mixed with lots of sand.

00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:25.860
The great Sir Isaac Newton gave us a
way of describing how fluids move with his
law of viscosity.

00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:32.000
Simply put, this law describes Newtonian fluids
as fluids with a viscosity that’s independent of stress.

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:35.860
No matter how much stress you put on the fluid,
its viscosity never changes.

00:04:35.860 --> 00:04:41.960
While no real fluid is perfectly Newtonian,
many fluids, like air and water, are close enough
that we can think of them that way.

00:04:41.960 --> 00:04:46.280
Non-Newtonian fluids, on the other hand, don’t
follow the law of viscosity.

00:04:46.280 --> 00:04:50.560
Their viscosity can change under stress, and
therefore their strain can, too.

00:04:50.560 --> 00:04:57.560
A non-Newtonian fluid will actually thicken or thin
out if you apply a force to it, which is exactly what
happens when you step into quicksand.

00:04:57.560 --> 00:05:01.060
The stress of you stepping onto it makes it
become less viscous.

00:05:01.060 --> 00:05:02.240
And then you’re in trouble.

00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:05.340
Now, there’s still the matter of how one
fluid moves within another fluid.

00:05:05.340 --> 00:05:09.400
And to understand that, we should turn to
the work of British engineer Osborne Reynolds.

00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:16.540
In 1868, just a year after graduating college,
Reynolds became the first professor of engineering
at Owens College in Manchester.

00:05:16.540 --> 00:05:22.820
He spent much of his career studying fluid
mechanics, and one of his greatest contributions
was his work on fluid flow patterns.

00:05:22.820 --> 00:05:29.480
In 1883, Reynolds conducted an experiment
that revealed there are two main types of flow
in a pipe: laminar and turbulent.

00:05:29.480 --> 00:05:35.900
This experiment was so influential that the
device that he used to conduct it was still used
well into the 21st century.

00:05:35.900 --> 00:05:40.120
In his experiment, Reynolds used a colored
fluid with the same density of water,

00:05:40.120 --> 00:05:45.460
and injected a very thin stream of it into a large
transparent tube with water flowing through it.

00:05:45.460 --> 00:05:52.080
When he injected the dye into slow-moving
water, the flow of the dye maintained its place
and pattern in the center of the water.

00:05:52.080 --> 00:05:53.780
We call this laminar flow.

00:05:53.780 --> 00:06:00.980
But when Reynolds injected the dye into water that
was moving fast, the dye spread out and diffused,
mixing with the water and coloring it.

00:06:00.980 --> 00:06:02.780
This is called turbulent flow.

00:06:02.780 --> 00:06:07.820
Those were the two main types of flow that
Reynolds found, but we also have something
called transitional flow.

00:06:07.820 --> 00:06:11.540
Transitional flow is a mixture of laminar
and turbulent flow.

00:06:11.540 --> 00:06:15.860
It often has turbulence in the center of the
pipe, and laminar flow near the edges.

00:06:15.860 --> 00:06:20.780
Reynolds’ experiment allowed him to
determine when the transition would occur
from laminar to turbulent,

00:06:20.780 --> 00:06:24.200
giving us the quantity we now know as
the Reynolds number.

00:06:24.200 --> 00:06:27.380
We can find the Reynolds number for the
flow of a fluid in a pipe

00:06:27.380 --> 00:06:36.420
by taking the diameter of the pipe and multiplying it
by the velocity of the fluid and the density of the fluid,
then dividing all of that by the viscosity of the fluid.

00:06:36.420 --> 00:06:44.720
Now, the value we get for our Reynolds number will be
dimensionless, meaning there are no units attached to it,
but it can tell us a lot about the movement of a fluid.

00:06:44.720 --> 00:06:48.860
It lets us know how predictable, or chaotic,
our fluid flow will be.

00:06:48.860 --> 00:06:53.960
That’s because we can look at the Reynolds
number as a ratio of inertial forces to viscous forces.

00:06:53.960 --> 00:07:02.300
Inertial forces represent the driving kinetic movement
of the fluid, which result in chaotic flow movement, like
the swirling motion of eddies and vortices.

00:07:02.300 --> 00:07:07.440
Viscous forces represent resistance to flow and
are more likely to provide slow, steady motion.

00:07:07.440 --> 00:07:12.920
So the more powerful your viscous forces are,
the slower and more controlled the fluid’s motion
will be.

00:07:12.920 --> 00:07:16.360
The higher your inertial forces are, the more
chaotic your flow will be.

00:07:16.360 --> 00:07:22.360
Therefore, a low Reynolds number
represents laminar flow, while a high Reynolds
number represents turbulent flow.

00:07:22.360 --> 00:07:30.880
In a pipe, laminar flows will usually have a
Reynolds number lower than 2100, while turbulent
flows will usually be higher than 4000.

00:07:30.880 --> 00:07:35.640
And a Reynolds number between these two values
typically represents transitional flow.

00:07:35.640 --> 00:07:40.700
Understanding fluid mechanics allows us
to use and apply equipment for fluid flow, like
pumps and pipes.

00:07:40.700 --> 00:07:45.440
And we can also apply this knowledge so
we can better understand how things move
inside a fluid.

00:07:45.440 --> 00:07:46.820
Like that new car we’re designing.

00:07:46.820 --> 00:07:54.060
If we’re testing our new car in a wind tunnel, we’ll
want to see how the air around the car is moving
and design our vehicle to account for the flow.

00:07:54.060 --> 00:08:01.160
The more resistance our cars have from the
air, the harder it is to go faster and the more fuel
they’ll need to use to travel at a given speed.

00:08:01.160 --> 00:08:04.480
This is why understanding fluid flow is so
important.

00:08:04.490 --> 00:08:08.649
So remember, it’s not just the system that
matters, but also the surroundings.

00:08:08.649 --> 00:08:10.719
Today was all about fluid mechanics.

00:08:10.720 --> 00:08:15.740
We talked about the different scales that
we work with as engineers as well as mass
and energy transfers.

00:08:15.740 --> 00:08:20.360
We learned about the no-slip condition and
the different types of stress and strain that
we’ll encounter.

00:08:20.360 --> 00:08:23.940
Newton’s law of viscosity gives us a way to
describe fluid movement,

00:08:23.940 --> 00:08:27.700
and Reynold’s number helps in determining the
difference between laminar and turbulent flow.

00:08:27.700 --> 00:08:33.460
I’ll see you next time, when we’ll learn
even more about fluid flow and some of the
equipment behind momentum transfer.

00:08:33.460 --> 00:08:37.599
