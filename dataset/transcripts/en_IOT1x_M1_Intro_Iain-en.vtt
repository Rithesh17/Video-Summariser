IAIN MURRAY: Welcome.

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:05.580
I'm Iain Murray, and I'm a Professor of Electrical

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:07.496
and Computer Engineering at Curtin University.

00:00:07.496 --> 00:00:10.620
And I'll be taking you through the Introduction to The Internet of Things.

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:12.660
My interest in the IoT comes from my background

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:14.490
in computer systems engineering.

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:16.710
I've been dealing with the internet basically

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:18.570
from the very early days when it was just

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:23.220
a group of academic machines all hooked together with email

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:25.650
and very little else that you could do with it.

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:29.640
The internet's evolved to a platform where we can share information.

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:31.650
We can find out facts.

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:32.910
We can meet with our friends.

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:36.330
We can have tele-conferences and talk to friends and relatives that

00:00:36.330 --> 00:00:37.535
may be miles away.

00:00:37.535 --> 00:00:38.910
The internet is changing.

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:41.370
And it's changing in profound ways.

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:43.619
It's no longer just a means of communication.

00:00:43.619 --> 00:00:46.410
We can use the internet to connect things that we wouldn't normally

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:48.960
think of putting onto the network, things

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:51.220
like your fridge for a simple example.

00:00:51.220 --> 00:00:54.540
Find out when your milk's going off and when you need to order some more.

00:00:54.540 --> 00:00:56.310
But it's more than that, much more.

00:00:56.310 --> 00:01:00.840
In medical areas, in manufacturing, in agriculture, the internet of things

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:02.850
is going to change the way we do things.

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:04.160
It gathers information.

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:06.270
It processes that information and presents it back

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:08.924
to human beings in a way they can understand.

00:01:08.924 --> 00:01:11.340
In the background, there's a lot of communication going on

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:14.270
between the machines-- machine to machine communication.

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:16.470
And we'll be looking closely at how this happens.

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:20.820
And that automates the processes so that humans can do what they do best,

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:23.010
make decisions on valid data.

00:01:23.010 --> 00:01:26.291
The internet of things is just in its very beginning stages.

00:01:26.291 --> 00:01:28.290
We're starting to see the connection of devices.

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:31.290
We're starting to see some places where the data is

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:34.960
being collected, and processed, and used in different ways.

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:38.482
So you may be wondering what the internet of things can do for us.

00:01:38.482 --> 00:01:39.690
Well, it can automate things.

00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:40.980
It can make our life easier.

00:01:40.980 --> 00:01:43.980
It can gather massive amounts of data that a human being can't really

00:01:43.980 --> 00:01:46.440
cope with, but we can use that to predict

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:48.090
what we need to do in the future.

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:49.470
We can look at trends.

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:53.160
We can take actions before failures occur,

00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:55.920
and generally just help us do a better job of what we're

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:58.149
doing now by embracing automation.

00:01:58.149 --> 00:01:59.940
So the Internet of Things-- it's wonderful.

00:01:59.940 --> 00:02:01.564
It's going to cure all of our problems.

00:02:01.564 --> 00:02:04.380
It's a solution to all of our worries in the world.

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:05.760
No, it's not.

00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:07.410
It is going to cause us some issues.

00:02:07.410 --> 00:02:10.289
Some of those issues include the security.

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:12.600
We all know about cybersecurity threats and how

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:14.520
hackers try to get into your computer.

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:17.580
Well, imagine when we've got 20 billion extra devices connected

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:18.490
to the internet.

00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:22.110
That's 20 billion more devices for hackers to try and get into.

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:23.020
It's a real issue.

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:25.491
And we'll be looking very closely at the security.

00:02:25.491 --> 00:02:28.740
If we're gathering all of this data, and there's lots of data we're gathering,

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:31.440
and it can be personal, and you can be walking past a sign,

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:33.420
and it'll announce you should go into this shop

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:35.670
because there's something in there that's of interest,

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:38.220
do we really want that invasion into our private space?

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:40.050
Do we want other people to know how we're

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:42.420
going to keep this information away from people

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:44.420
we don't want to find out about it?

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:47.790
The Internet of Things will also cause a major disruption in employment.

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:49.470
There will be a change.

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:52.260
People will be losing their jobs.

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:56.110
But the good news is far more jobs will be created in the area.

00:02:56.110 --> 00:02:58.230
These jobs will require a higher skill level.

00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:01.260
Instead of the person who's manufacturing cars just tightening

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:04.680
bolts, they will need to be able to maintain the robotics,

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:08.760
or control the production line, monitor the dashboards

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:11.880
of the information that's being collected from the manufacturing line.

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:14.550
So the jobs will be far more skilled, which probably

00:03:14.550 --> 00:03:16.320
means they will be better paid.

00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:17.820
But there will be far fewer of them.

00:03:17.820 --> 00:03:19.737
And this is an issue we need to confront.

00:03:19.737 --> 00:03:21.945
So you may be asking yourself where will this impact?

00:03:21.945 --> 00:03:25.410
Where will the greatest impact be in the near future?

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:27.270
Well, I've got no idea.

00:03:27.270 --> 00:03:29.037
And I don't think anyone really has.

00:03:29.037 --> 00:03:30.870
This is something that we've got to explore.

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:34.110
We've got to look at where will the resources that we save be used.

00:03:34.110 --> 00:03:38.490
Will we just save resources and not use that benefit?

00:03:38.490 --> 00:03:39.720
I wouldn't think so.

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:43.290
So we really need to start examining where the impact will be

00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:46.330
and what these savings will actually mean to industries.

00:03:46.330 --> 00:03:48.840
Right, so, generally, that's the Internet of Things.

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:51.930
Let's now have a look at some applications and case studies

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:55.190
of the Internet of Things in the real world.
