DR. SCOTT HOLLIER: I'm Dr. Scott Hollier.

00:00:04.360 --> 00:00:05.940
I'm a digital access specialist.

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:09.040
I've worked in the corporate, government, and not-for-profit sectors

00:00:09.040 --> 00:00:10.840
for about 15 years.

00:00:10.840 --> 00:00:13.840
And a big part of my focus is to ensure that people with disabilities

00:00:13.840 --> 00:00:16.750
get access to computers and internet-related technologies.

00:00:16.750 --> 00:00:19.910
For people with disabilities, there are a lot of great benefits.

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:22.957
And I think one of the really helpful benefits,

00:00:22.957 --> 00:00:25.290
particularly for people who are blind or vision impaired

00:00:25.290 --> 00:00:27.670
and people with mobility impairment is that they're

00:00:27.670 --> 00:00:29.830
able to engage with devices in a way that would

00:00:29.830 --> 00:00:32.110
be tricky or cumbersome otherwise.

00:00:32.110 --> 00:00:34.870
For example, I'm a legally blind person.

00:00:34.870 --> 00:00:36.850
And as someone who is legally blind, it's

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:40.420
great that when I want to say, put on a radio station,

00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:44.020
I don't have to go to the stereo and fiddle with the knobs

00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:46.990
and try and read a display that my eyes don't pick up.

00:00:46.990 --> 00:00:50.740
I can just go to a digital assistant and I can just say,

00:00:50.740 --> 00:00:54.730
hey, Google, play SBS Chill on TuneIn or something like that,

00:00:54.730 --> 00:00:57.982
and it will immediately play that station for me.

00:00:57.982 --> 00:01:00.940
For someone in a wheelchair, if they can't reach buttons on the device,

00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:04.489
then they can also give commands through their smartphone

00:01:04.489 --> 00:01:07.349
or through a digital assistant to be able to engage with that.

00:01:07.349 --> 00:01:09.640
We're seeing more and more products evolving now, which

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:11.590
are really providing great support.

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:14.470
And it's not too far away when we'll be able to engage,

00:01:14.470 --> 00:01:17.260
for example, being able to send a recipe to a microwave

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:22.180
and the device continues to cook that meal

00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:25.390
and also be able to tell us how it's going as it does so.

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:29.740
So from a disability perspective, having a lot of these benefits

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:32.260
will make a real and profound difference,

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:34.420
even in these very early days.

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:37.570
Being able to use sensors to adjust heating,

00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:40.480
having medical conditions monitored, and being aware

00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:43.420
of how that's going through the Internet of Things really

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:45.220
is making a big difference now.

00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:48.420
And it's going to make an even bigger difference in the future.
