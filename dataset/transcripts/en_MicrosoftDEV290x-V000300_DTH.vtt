00:00:00.860 --> 00:00:03.330
>> Before we get into the details of

00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:06.270
image processing and building models for computer vision,

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:09.210
let's start by examining what an image is.

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:11.760
Now, to you and I, an image,

00:00:11.760 --> 00:00:14.895
like a photograph, is a visual representation of something.

00:00:14.895 --> 00:00:16.949
In this case, it's a photo of landscape,

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:19.965
and includes a plane or train, and an automobile.

00:00:19.965 --> 00:00:22.200
To a computer program,

00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:24.930
this image is made up of a matrix of pixels,

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:28.020
each pixel having an intensity that's represented as

00:00:28.020 --> 00:00:32.205
a numerical value between 0-255.

00:00:32.205 --> 00:00:36.480
Now in fact, this image is a color JPEG image.

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:39.150
So, it's actually a three-dimensional matrix,

00:00:39.150 --> 00:00:40.575
with channels for red,

00:00:40.575 --> 00:00:43.995
green, and blue pixel intensities.

00:00:43.995 --> 00:00:46.930
For each pixel in the matrix,

00:00:46.930 --> 00:00:49.670
the intensity values across these three channels

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:52.940
combine to create a full spectrum of colors,

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:55.900
and varying the pixel values in each layer,

00:00:55.900 --> 00:00:58.870
changes the overall visual effect.
