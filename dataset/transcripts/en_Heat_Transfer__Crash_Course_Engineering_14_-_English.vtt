00:00:02.920 --> 00:00:09.100
Whether you’re heating up leftovers from
last night, or just trying to stay cool in the
summer, heat transfer is everywhere.

00:00:09.100 --> 00:00:11.800
In some ways, the world is literally built
around it.

00:00:11.800 --> 00:00:17.960
Any well-engineered building is designed and
made out of materials that help keep the inside
of the building at a good temperature,

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:20.940
even during bitter blizzards or horrendous heat waves.

00:00:20.940 --> 00:00:28.040
A furnace or A/C will only get you so far – without
protecting against heat transfer, you might as well
try to air condition your whole neighborhood.

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:35.080
A big part of engineering is using your knowledge
of natural processes to keep them from interfering
with whatever you’re trying to do –

00:00:35.080 --> 00:00:38.260
or in some cases, taking advantage of
those processes.

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:44.200
So without a solid understanding of how and
why heat moves the way it does, your designs
won’t be very successful.

00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:47.500
Especially if you’ve just discovered a tropical
island.

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:57.920
[Theme Music]

00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:59.860
So. This tropical island.

00:00:59.860 --> 00:01:05.360
It’s small, totally deserted, and seems
like the perfect place to build that vacation
home you’ve always dreamed of.

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:09.410
The tropical weather is really nice, but it’s
also hot – very hot.

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:13.470
So you’ll probably want to design your house
to keep the heat out, and the cold in.

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:16.760
In other words: you’ll want to prevent as
much heat transfer as possible.

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:24.080
Even though heat isn’t a fluid itself, heat transfers
in a way that’s kind of similar to the fluid movement
we’ve talked about in past episodes.

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:30.240
When fluids move, there’s always a driving
force behind them – specifically, a difference
in either pressure or velocity.

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:33.420
With heat transfer, the driving force is a
difference in temperature.

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:37.880
In fact, if you don’t have a temperature
difference, you can’t have heat transfer.
Period.

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:41.920
If you have two boxes right next to each other,
and they’re both at the same temperature,

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:45.900
then one of the boxes won’t randomly start
giving its heat energy away to the other one.

00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:49.940
But if you're watching this video on your
laptop and it’s, well, on top of your lap,

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:54.600
then your legs might be warming up as heat
is transferred to them from your laptop.

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:59.740
That’s because right now your laptop is warmer
than your skin, and when heat passively transfers,

00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:02.740
it always moves from a higher temperature
to a lower one.

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:09.400
You'd have to use the cycles and work energy
we’ve talked about before – basically, an engine –
to make it move in the opposite direction.

00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:17.200
And unless you have perfect insulation, which
is practically impossible in most settings, then a
temperature difference will cause heat transfer.

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:21.340
So, this house you’re building is going to heat up
from the warm, tropical air no matter what.

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:23.940
But there’s a lot you can do to slow down
the process.

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:29.260
There are three main types of heat transfer
to look out for: conduction, convection, and
radiation.

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:34.220
With conduction, heat energy is transferred
by the collisions of molecules or other particles.

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:41.660
When two things touch, the faster moving
molecules of the warmer object crash into the
slower moving molecules of the colder object,

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:44.000
transferring energy that heats them up.

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:47.580
In your house, that will cause heat transfer
through the layers of the walls.

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:52.560
As the outer layer warms up, conduction will
transfer the heat through to the cooler inner layers.

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:59.100
To slow this down, you’ll want to build the walls
out of a material with low thermal conductivity –
something that doesn’t transfer heat well.

00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:05.980
Copper, for example, has a high thermal conductivity,
so if you made your walls out of it, you’d effectively
be making a giant sauna.

00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:08.140
Which doesn’t sound like a great place to
live.

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:10.740
For one thing, it would probably be a burn
hazard.

00:03:10.740 --> 00:03:16.740
Materials like brick and drywall, on the other
hand, have lower thermal conductivities, so
they’d be much better choices.

00:03:16.740 --> 00:03:22.560
Anything that’s sold as insulation also
has a very low thermal conductivity, so you’ll
probably want some layers of that, too.

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:27.120
The thicker these layers, the more resistant
the walls will be to heat transfer by conduction.

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:30.880
Specifically, they’ll have more of what’s
called thermal resistance,

00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:38.360
which is defined as the thickness of the layer
of material, divided by the material’s thermal
conductivity and the area of the layer.

00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:45.960
All this means is that materials with a lower thermal
conductivity have a higher thermal resistance, and that a
thicker layer will also have a higher thermal resistance.

00:03:45.960 --> 00:03:50.760
But if there’s more area for heat to be conducted
through, that will lower the thermal resistance.

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:55.560
Thermal resistance is also equal to the temperature
difference divided by the heat transfer rate.

00:03:55.560 --> 00:03:56.980
Which also makes sense.

00:03:56.980 --> 00:04:03.720
It means that for a given temperature difference,
materials with a higher heat transfer rate will have
a lower thermal resistance, and vice versa.

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:08.100
You can use this equation to determine
the level of thermal resistance you’ll need

00:04:08.100 --> 00:04:14.020
if you want a low rate of heat transfer for
the temperature difference you’d expect to
have in the layers of your walls.

00:04:14.020 --> 00:04:21.920
And the resistance of the different layers adds up,
so the total thermal resistance of the walls is equal
to the resistance of each layer combined.

00:04:21.920 --> 00:04:24.520
It’s like putting on layers of clothing
on a cold day.

00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:29.800
The more layers you have, the lower your rate of
heat loss will be, and the easier it is to stay warm.

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:38.320
So for your house, if the drywall and brick don’t have
enough thermal resistance to keep the inside cool,
you can add layers of insulation to up the resistance.

00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:42.860
That takes care of the heat transfer within the walls,
but there’s more going on outside of them.

00:04:42.860 --> 00:04:45.520
Which brings us to the second method of
heat transfer:

00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:52.440
convection, the transfer of energy by the
physical movement of a fluid – which in
engineering, can be a liquid or a gas.

00:04:52.440 --> 00:04:56.580
As a fluid moves against or across a surface,
it can add or take away heat.

00:04:56.580 --> 00:05:00.960
For example, as air heats up, its particles
spread out, lowering its density.

00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:06.240
That warmer air rises, taking heat energy
with it, and is replaced by cooler, denser air.

00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:12.750
That’s called natural convection, because
variations in the temperature of the fluid create
natural movement without any external forces.

00:05:12.750 --> 00:05:18.040
There’s also forced convection, where something
external like a fan or the wind moves the fluid.

00:05:18.040 --> 00:05:22.460
Heat transfer by convection actually involves
some conduction, especially at first.

00:05:22.460 --> 00:05:25.740
When the warm outside air comes into contact
with your house’s walls,

00:05:25.740 --> 00:05:31.460
it creates the no-slip condition we’ve talked
about before, where the layer touching the surface
comes to a stop.

00:05:31.460 --> 00:05:36.080
Right on top of that, there’s what’s called
a boundary layer, where the air is moving,
but slowly.

00:05:36.080 --> 00:05:39.120
The lower velocity slows down the rate of
heat transfer,

00:05:39.120 --> 00:05:43.880
creating a thermal boundary layer where
there’s more conduction between the particles,
and less convection.

00:05:43.880 --> 00:05:48.880
Beyond the boundary layer, though, heat transfer
mostly happens by convection through the faster-moving air.

00:05:48.880 --> 00:05:56.820
You can measure how much heat is being transferred
by convection using what’s known as the convective
heat transfer coefficient, represented by the letter h.

00:05:56.820 --> 00:06:02.000
It’s proportional to the thermal conductivity of
the fluid over the thickness of the boundary layer,

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:07.020
which just means that thinner fluids with higher
thermal conductivity will transfer more heat.

00:06:07.020 --> 00:06:08.000
Makes sense.

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:10.660
h also depends on how fast a fluid is moving.

00:06:10.660 --> 00:06:14.360
The less a gas moves around, the less heat
is transferred through convection.

00:06:14.370 --> 00:06:16.690
That’s why windows often have double panes.

00:06:16.690 --> 00:06:21.800
The air trapped between the layers of glass
can’t move very much, reducing the heat transfer.

00:06:21.800 --> 00:06:24.820
So, double-paned windows are probably a good
idea for your house.

00:06:24.820 --> 00:06:31.480
There’s not much else you can do to minimize the
effects of convection, since you can’t really control
what the air does as it moves around outside.

00:06:31.480 --> 00:06:35.640
But you can reduce the effects of the last
type of heat transfer: radiation.

00:06:35.640 --> 00:06:39.680
Radiation is the transfer of energy in the
form of electromagnetic waves –

00:06:39.680 --> 00:06:45.440
and in this context, we’re talking about
any electromagnetic waves, not just the
cancer-causing kind.

00:06:45.440 --> 00:06:50.120
You feel this radiation every time you walk
outside and bask in the sun or warm up by a fire.

00:06:50.120 --> 00:06:55.940
Unlike conduction and convection, radiation
can happen without any contact between the
heat source and the object.

00:06:55.940 --> 00:06:59.160
That’s why heat energy from the sun is able
to reach the earth.

00:06:59.160 --> 00:07:05.900
Reflective coatings can help reduce the heat
transfer from radiation a little since they absorb
fewer electromagnetic waves.

00:07:05.900 --> 00:07:10.740
But when it comes to radiation, where your
house is will be much more important than
what it’s made of.

00:07:10.740 --> 00:07:17.400
Since the sun will likely be the biggest radiative
source, you’ll want to build the house somewhere
it won’t get too much direct sunlight.

00:07:17.400 --> 00:07:21.420
So, there are a lot of factors to consider
when you’re trying to minimize heat transfer.

00:07:21.420 --> 00:07:26.520
But with a shady spot, walls with lots of thermal
resistance, and some double-paned windows,

00:07:26.520 --> 00:07:30.440
you should have a pretty comfortable
place to hang out on your tropical island.

00:07:30.440 --> 00:07:35.580
So today we learned all about heat transfer
and the different mechanisms behind it.

00:07:35.580 --> 00:07:39.740
We started with conduction and learned about
the thermal conductivity of materials.

00:07:39.740 --> 00:07:45.840
Then we moved on to convection and
boundary layers, learning that convection
can be both forced and natural.

00:07:45.840 --> 00:07:53.480
Finally, we covered radiation and how it differs
from the other two methods in that it doesn’t need
an intervening medium to transfer heat energy.

00:07:53.480 --> 00:07:59.120
Next time we’ll talk all about how we can
use what we just learned about heat transfer,
and apply that to heat exchangers.
