00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:07.740
These days, alchemy gets a bad rap.

00:00:07.750 --> 00:00:12.000
In fantasy stories, charlatans in fancy robes
promise to turn lead into gold.

00:00:12.010 --> 00:00:15.320
But real alchemists weren’t just mystical
misers.

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:19.250
They were skilled experimentalists, backed
by theories of matter.

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:23.480
And they played a huge role in the development
of knowledge about one of our fundamental

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:25.600
questions: “what is stuff?”

00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:29.340
Do chemists today spend a lot of time trying
to turn lead into gold?

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:34.800
No—but, in part they are the inheritors of a
wealth of knowledge created by alchemists

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:36.389
who were trying to turn lead into gold!

00:00:36.389 --> 00:00:38.010
Why did they keep doing that?

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:39.739
Did they really think it would work?

00:00:39.739 --> 00:00:41.600
Was it some science experiment?

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:43.210
Or a religious ritual?

00:00:43.210 --> 00:00:44.210
Yes! All of those things.

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:48.559
Today, we’ll meet some alchemists and consider
just what the heck they were doing all day

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:53.060
with metals, and how they sought to understand
stuff.

00:00:53.060 --> 00:01:01.400
[Intro Music Plays]

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:05.370
The word “alchemy,” which is where we
get the word “chemistry” from, is a bit

00:01:05.370 --> 00:01:06.370
of mystery.

00:01:06.370 --> 00:01:09.890
It might mean “the black earth,” symbolizing
Egypt, but it might not.

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:15.290
Either way, all of these words were used in
Europe before 1600 to describe the same system.

00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:20.140
Let’s define alchemy as a way of thinking
philosophically about stuff by changing it.

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:26.070
This included older astrological ideas alongside
new ones derived from experiment and observation.

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:30.100
Alchemy parallels the Scholastic medical tradition
we looked at last time.

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:33.600
Both systems spanned across Eurasia and relied
on books.

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:38.850
But the alchemists had different social norms,
or ideas about how someone creating knowledge

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:40.170
should act.

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:44.850
Alchemists did publish books, but typically
encoded their philosophies in complicated

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:50.060
allegories, or stories wherein the characters
and actions stand for something other than

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:51.219
what they appear.

00:01:51.219 --> 00:01:55.799
This essentially rendered whole alchemical
systems secret except to their own friends.

00:01:55.799 --> 00:02:00.740
They used code words called Decknamen: so
“tin” might literally mean the metal tin

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:04.009
in one book, but serve as a code word for
silver in another.

00:02:04.009 --> 00:02:08.330
The books were illustrated, but many of the
images were symbols masking their true meanings.

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:13.550
The good and bad thing about the Decknamen
system was that anyone could read any proto-scientific

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:18.020
treatise on “what is stuff?” and come
away with almost any conclusion.

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:23.640
Good thing today we have the internet to help everyone agree on scientific questions based on evidence... right?

00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:28.440
A lot of alchemical books focused on transmutation,
or changing metals into other metals.

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:35.120
In theory—all the way back to Aristotle—transmutation
mimicked a natural process: metals were compounds,

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:40.150
formed deep in the earth when different quantities
of sulfur and mercury were crushed together.

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:44.720
Miners had been working with metals for years—digging
them up and then heating them to purify them.

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:49.030
The difference for alchemists though was that
transmutation meant “hacking” this whole

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:50.830
process by doing it artificially.

00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:55.910
But… the alchemical metals are not compounds
of anything—they’re elements!

00:02:55.910 --> 00:03:00.790
So how did the alchemists take non-compounds
and “read” them as compounds?

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:03.769
The alchemists had problems obtaining pure
samples.

00:03:03.769 --> 00:03:08.310
When they heated up chunks of metal, these
would bubble and change color based on impurities,

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:10.379
meaning tiny bits of other elements.

00:03:10.379 --> 00:03:15.220
But, alas—metals, when isolated, don’t
actually break down into sulphur and mercury.

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:19.530
There were two kinds of alchemical metals:
the noble metals were gold, which represented

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:20.530
the sun.

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:22.319
And silver, which represented the moon.

00:03:22.319 --> 00:03:27.409
The base metals included mercury, which represented
the planet Mercury, copper for Venus, iron

00:03:27.409 --> 00:03:32.069
for warlike Mars, tin for Jupiter, and lead
for slow sad Saturn.

00:03:32.069 --> 00:03:36.269
In fact, our name for the metal “mercury”
comes from this alchemical association with

00:03:36.269 --> 00:03:37.720
the Greek messenger god!

00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:42.319
Agents of transmutation also fell into two
categories: particulars, which only did one

00:03:42.319 --> 00:03:47.890
thing—for example, change copper into silver—and
universals, meaning the “philosopher’s

00:03:47.890 --> 00:03:48.890
stone.”

00:03:48.890 --> 00:03:52.569
That’s philosopher’s stone—no sorcerers
involved, American Harry Potter.

00:03:52.569 --> 00:03:55.860
This mysterious stone could change any base
metal into gold.

00:03:55.860 --> 00:04:01.150
The quest for the universal transmutation
agent was called chrysopoeia, or, literally,

00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:02.680
“make into gold.”

00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:06.829
To get started, a “chrysopoeian” would
combine the right ingredients in an egg-shaped

00:04:06.829 --> 00:04:10.959
vessel called an alembic, and then heat the
mixture up for a long time.

00:04:10.959 --> 00:04:14.390
What were the right ingredients to make the
philosopher’s stone?

00:04:14.390 --> 00:04:15.390
Alchemists disagreed.

00:04:15.390 --> 00:04:17.801
The fact that they didn’t even agree on
what the philosopher’s stone actually was,

00:04:17.801 --> 00:04:19.770
pretty much symbolizes the whole system.

00:04:19.770 --> 00:04:24.730
Chrysopoeia required fine-tuning the practice
of metallurgy: alchemists had to heat ingredients

00:04:24.730 --> 00:04:30.260
for days on end, controlling the temperature
precisely without the aid of modern lab equipment,

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:31.760
or even a thermometer!

00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:33.990
It was difficult, sweaty work.

00:04:33.990 --> 00:04:38.970
Eventually, the mix of ingredients would turn
black, then white, then yellow, and finally

00:04:38.970 --> 00:04:39.970
red.

00:04:39.970 --> 00:04:42.440
At this point, if your oven hadn’t exploded—you
won!

00:04:42.440 --> 00:04:47.490
You now had a lump of red substance that,
when heated up with base metals, changed them

00:04:47.490 --> 00:04:48.910
into gold.

00:04:48.910 --> 00:04:50.030
Supposedly.

00:04:50.030 --> 00:04:55.670
The search for the philosopher’s stone produced
new alchemical theories and felt like a wonder,

00:04:55.670 --> 00:05:00.570
inspiring generations of experimenters, even
if it never quite “worked.”

00:05:00.570 --> 00:05:05.740
Alchemy persisted because transmutation clearly
produced something, including new compounds.

00:05:05.740 --> 00:05:09.580
The problem is that we don’t always know
what it produced, because of the whole secret

00:05:09.580 --> 00:05:10.580
code thing.

00:05:10.580 --> 00:05:15.270
“Luna fixa”, for example, was a dense
white metal, that was corrosion resistant,

00:05:15.270 --> 00:05:18.330
had a high melting point, and was pretty soft.

00:05:18.330 --> 00:05:21.640
Was it platinum, white gold, or something
else entirely?

00:05:21.640 --> 00:05:24.160
But alchemy was never only about metals.

00:05:24.160 --> 00:05:28.060
The human body, for example, was understood
as an alchemical workshop:

00:05:28.060 --> 00:05:33.170
chemical reactions happened in the organs,
transmuting one kind of stuff into another.

00:05:33.170 --> 00:05:34.420
This is still pretty amazing!

00:05:34.420 --> 00:05:39.830
We eat stuff that is not at all human—at
least hopefully—and then that stuff somehow

00:05:39.830 --> 00:05:41.080
becomes us.

00:05:41.080 --> 00:05:45.110
In an alchemical framework, illnesses were
reactions gone wrong.

00:05:45.110 --> 00:05:50.150
So while the alchemists included metallurgists,
mine directors, goldsmiths, and natural philosophers,

00:05:50.150 --> 00:05:51.740
they were often physicians,

00:05:51.740 --> 00:05:56.590
interested in making efficacious compounds
called pharmaceuticals, or chematria.

00:05:56.590 --> 00:06:01.620
In fact, alchemy was a system for producing
useful materials from chematria to alcohol,

00:06:01.620 --> 00:06:05.090
alloys, pigments, perfumes, and cleaning products.

00:06:05.090 --> 00:06:08.650
Noblewomen alchemists, tasked with caring
for the health of the workers in their husbands’

00:06:08.650 --> 00:06:11.590
manors, played a major role in producing therapeutics.

00:06:11.590 --> 00:06:18.400
These noblewomen set up production facilities—proto-labs—and
expanded the repertoire of alchemical products

00:06:18.400 --> 00:06:19.520
which could be sold.

00:06:19.520 --> 00:06:24.320
And the system itself was heavily gendered,
metaphorically, which we can see in many gorgeous

00:06:24.320 --> 00:06:29.280
illustrations of allegorical kings and queens
of heaven, the kings and queens of stuff.

00:06:29.280 --> 00:06:33.830
One of the wackier life-sciencey practices
that came out of the ancient and medieval

00:06:33.830 --> 00:06:36.010
search to understand therapeutic compounds

00:06:36.010 --> 00:06:42.060
was palingenesis, or “life again”: the
idea that you could bring things back to life

00:06:42.060 --> 00:06:45.550
by burning them, and then freezing their ashes.

00:06:45.550 --> 00:06:49.000
Alchemists spent a lot of time burning and
freezing leaves.

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:50.380
Did palingenesis work?

00:06:50.380 --> 00:06:54.190
Why don’t you go try it and see if you get
better results!?

00:06:54.190 --> 00:06:58.350
At least, it might make you pay careful attention
to living things and what stuff they seem

00:06:58.350 --> 00:06:59.350
to be made out of.

00:06:59.350 --> 00:07:02.170
On second thought I'm not gonna encourage you to go burn stuff.

00:07:02.170 --> 00:07:06.430
Just as there are multiple sciences today,
there were multiple “alchemies” in medieval

00:07:06.430 --> 00:07:07.430
Eurasia.

00:07:07.430 --> 00:07:10.110
Chinese alchemy was tied into ideas about
the earth itself.

00:07:10.110 --> 00:07:14.290
Remember how, in Chinese natural philosophy,
the earth was one living organism?

00:07:14.290 --> 00:07:19.970
Chinese alchemists detected its vital channels
of energy transmission using magnets, formalizing

00:07:19.970 --> 00:07:23.200
that system of earth magic called feng shui.

00:07:23.200 --> 00:07:25.450
This work eventually led to the invention
of gunpowder.

00:07:25.450 --> 00:07:29.490
Chinese alchemy also included a search for
immortality called waidan.

00:07:29.490 --> 00:07:31.720
But still no “sorcerers,” sadly.

00:07:31.720 --> 00:07:35.310
Mostly, waidan was about self-experimentation
and diet.

00:07:35.310 --> 00:07:39.910
Indian alchemy focused on medicine, on forms
of mercury, and on how to preserve health

00:07:39.910 --> 00:07:42.800
and hopefully create an undecayable body.

00:07:42.800 --> 00:07:47.310
We’ve talked before about how an Ayurvedic
textbook or samhita had a whole chapter on

00:07:47.310 --> 00:07:50.360
aphrodisiacs and another on toxicology.

00:07:50.360 --> 00:07:54.630
Alchemy supplied a way of developing these
love potions and poisons.

00:07:54.630 --> 00:08:00.020
Islamicate alchemy, meanwhile, blended Aristotelian,
Chinese, and Indian alchemical practices.

00:08:00.020 --> 00:08:05.170
Jābir ibn Hayyān, born in Persia in 721
and known in Europe as “Geber”,

00:08:05.170 --> 00:08:07.950
was credited with authoring three thousand
texts!

00:08:07.950 --> 00:08:12.990
These included a version of the Emerald Tablet,
a supposedly ancient Greek text that included

00:08:12.990 --> 00:08:15.460
a guide to creating the philosopher’s stone.

00:08:15.460 --> 00:08:21.220
Hayyan also worked on mineralogy, transmutation,
and medicinal elixirs and invented new equipment.

00:08:21.220 --> 00:08:27.260
Like many alchemists, Hayyan often wrote allegorically,
trying in his own words to intentionally “baffle”

00:08:27.260 --> 00:08:30.070
most readers except those “whom God loves.”

00:08:30.070 --> 00:08:34.819
But the person most famous today for his work
in alchemy is the Swiss physician and iconoclast

00:08:34.819 --> 00:08:35.990
Paracelsus,

00:08:35.990 --> 00:08:41.449
born in 1493, who also was called Theophrastus
Bombastus von Hohenheim.

00:08:41.449 --> 00:08:45.480
Think Gregory House meets Victor Frankenstein
meets Miss Cleo.

00:08:45.480 --> 00:08:50.610
In addition to his general irascibility, Paracelsus
is famous today for the phrase “the dose

00:08:50.610 --> 00:08:51.810
makes the poison.”

00:08:51.810 --> 00:08:55.850
Paracelsus also believed that the philosopher’s
stone was a “universal solvent” called

00:08:55.850 --> 00:08:56.980
the alkahest,

00:08:56.980 --> 00:09:01.400
which was derived from lime, alcohol, and
carbonate of potash and could theoretically

00:09:01.400 --> 00:09:03.129
dissolve anything, even gold.

00:09:03.129 --> 00:09:08.850
And, most radically, Paracelsus introduced
salt as a third element that made up all metals.

00:09:08.850 --> 00:09:12.850
Paracelsus was a critic of university natural
philosophers and physicians.

00:09:12.850 --> 00:09:17.329
He saw these Scholastics as likely to mistake
textual generalizations for truths.

00:09:17.329 --> 00:09:22.600
He admonished his alchemical colleagues not
to trust the words of the ancient masters.

00:09:22.600 --> 00:09:26.790
But then he became a master himself—someone
you could write books in the style of.

00:09:26.790 --> 00:09:31.519
You could say that alchemy, like other knowledge-making
systems, was torn between text and experiment—

00:09:31.519 --> 00:09:37.160
that is, between loyalty to tradition and
iconoclasm, and a return to basic observation.

00:09:37.160 --> 00:09:40.889
Thus, even if alchemical books were often
secret-concealing gibberish,

00:09:40.889 --> 00:09:46.149
they were important in supporting a long-term
rational debate about the true nature of stuff.

00:09:46.149 --> 00:09:50.930
In fact, the most famous product of alchemy
was a wondrous invention that most people

00:09:50.930 --> 00:09:53.519
don’t think of as alchemical.

00:09:53.519 --> 00:09:55.079
Help us out, ThoughtBubble:

00:09:55.079 --> 00:10:01.740
Johannes Gensfleisch zur Laden zum Gutenberg,
born in Germany in 1468, was a metallurgist

00:10:01.740 --> 00:10:05.269
who invented a process for mass producing
movable type.

00:10:05.269 --> 00:10:11.730
Gutenberg made his type from an alloy of lead,
tin, and antimony, creating a more durable

00:10:11.730 --> 00:10:12.730
system.

00:10:12.730 --> 00:10:17.070
He also pioneered working with oil-based ink
and made tweaks to the common cheese press

00:10:17.070 --> 00:10:18.569
to make his printing press.

00:10:18.569 --> 00:10:22.950
His real achievement, though, was bringing
all of these together into a system that made

00:10:22.950 --> 00:10:24.699
printing books economical.

00:10:24.699 --> 00:10:30.339
And I mean way more economical than having
rooms full of monks hand-copying manuscripts.

00:10:30.339 --> 00:10:34.249
Economical printing meant better-duplicated
texts with fewer errors.!

00:10:34.249 --> 00:10:39.240
Knowledge circulated not simply thanks to
personal travel, which was slow and somewhat

00:10:39.240 --> 00:10:41.180
random, but as discrete knowledge.

00:10:41.180 --> 00:10:46.200
Some of this knowledge was intentionally secret
code—which presents a problem for historians

00:10:46.200 --> 00:10:47.200
today.

00:10:47.200 --> 00:10:51.480
How do we figure out what the alchemists meant
when they wrote things like, “The wind blows

00:10:51.480 --> 00:10:53.970
over the marriage of the moon and Saturn?”

00:10:53.970 --> 00:10:58.420
How do we interpret alchemical recipes encoded
entirely in pictures?

00:10:58.420 --> 00:10:59.420
Thanks Thought Bubble!

00:10:59.420 --> 00:11:01.209
So what happened to alchemy?

00:11:01.209 --> 00:11:03.970
Parts of it became chemistry, which we’ll
get to later.

00:11:03.970 --> 00:11:09.430
But alchemy also became increasingly seen
as dirty, dangerous, unsavory, low-class,

00:11:09.430 --> 00:11:12.680
and lacking a classical pedigree, unlike,
say, astronomy.

00:11:12.680 --> 00:11:17.829
And, in Europe, alchemy was tied to a geocentric
cosmology that goes out of fashion in the

00:11:17.829 --> 00:11:19.269
sixteenth century.

00:11:19.269 --> 00:11:23.339
There were notable alchemists in the seventeenth
century, including Isaac Newton.

00:11:23.339 --> 00:11:27.230
But by this time, chemists wanted a more scientific
society.

00:11:27.230 --> 00:11:32.499
Publicly, alchemy was attacked as superstition,
even as practitioners keep doing it in private.

00:11:32.499 --> 00:11:37.070
Alchemy went underground for most of the eighteenth
century, maintained in secret societies, before

00:11:37.070 --> 00:11:38.170
dying out.

00:11:38.170 --> 00:11:43.910
The once-famous book De re metallica, or Concerning
the Nature of Metals, was first translated

00:11:43.910 --> 00:11:45.951
into English by classicist Herbert Hoover—

00:11:45.951 --> 00:11:51.600
who was also a president—and his wife, Lou
Henry Hoover, in 1912.

00:11:51.600 --> 00:11:52.720
Fascinating!

00:11:52.720 --> 00:11:57.430
Next time—pack your mortarboard hats and
masonry tools: we’re tracking the rise of

00:11:57.430 --> 00:11:59.449
the university and the cathedral!

00:11:59.449 --> 00:12:03.420
Crash Course History of Science is filmed
in the Dr. Cheryl C. Kinney studio in Missoula,

00:12:03.420 --> 00:12:07.830
Montana and it’s made with the help of all
this nice people and our animation team is

00:12:07.830 --> 00:12:08.830
Thought Cafe.

00:12:08.830 --> 00:12:11.029
Crash Course is a Complexly production.

00:12:11.029 --> 00:12:13.410
If you wanna keep imagining the world complexly
with us,

00:12:13.410 --> 00:12:16.920
