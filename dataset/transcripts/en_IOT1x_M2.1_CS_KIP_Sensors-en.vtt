PAUL NICHOLLS: For a vehicle to become fully autonomous,

00:00:05.020 --> 00:00:08.900
it needs to take over the roles and responsibility of a human.

00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:11.480
In a normal car, a human would be doing lots of things.

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:13.690
They'd be detecting the information that's coming in.

00:00:13.690 --> 00:00:15.270
They'd be steering the vehicle.

00:00:15.270 --> 00:00:18.710
They'd be controlling the accelerator and the brakes.

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:22.250
In an autonomous vehicle, all of those things are taken away from the human.

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:26.240
Instead, the bus is actually detecting what's happening around it.

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:28.190
It's making the decisions about how it turns,

00:00:28.190 --> 00:00:32.340
and it's controlling the technologies on the bus to get us from point A

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:34.040
to point B.

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:38.690
IMAN KAREEM: So one of the main sensors that we use for Kip is 360 Lidar.

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:41.270
So basically how Lidar works, it's very similar to radar,

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:44.810
except that it shoots out laser beams, 360 degrees.

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:47.000
And so, based on that, it's able to tell--

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:51.410
Kip is able to tell how far objects are and where objects are, relative

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:52.730
to its position.

00:00:52.730 --> 00:00:56.670
Similar to the 360 Lidar, we have 2D Lidars down at the bottom.

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:59.390
And what it does is that it can see objects in front of it--

00:00:59.390 --> 00:01:03.050
for example, people walking or a car in front of it.

00:01:03.050 --> 00:01:08.310
And, based on that, Kip is able to tell when to stop or when to slow down.

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:11.250
We also do have stereo cameras over here.

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:15.316
So hopefully we will be able to read stop signs and red lights.

00:01:15.316 --> 00:01:17.190
The bus is actually completely bidirectional,

00:01:17.190 --> 00:01:20.544
so it can go 45 kilometers on that side and on this side.

00:01:20.544 --> 00:01:21.710
So what do we see over here?

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:22.760
The sensors.

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:26.100
We have exactly on the other side.

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:29.780
Much like the front and the back, we do have a 2D Lidar on the sides.

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:32.390
So that's basically to detect how far the curb is,

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:35.180
how far the bus stop is, so that it's really close,

00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:37.220
so that people can get on.

00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:40.220
And on the wheels we have sensors, to actually know

00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:42.380
how fast each wheel is moving.

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:47.610
And, based on that, Kip's accuracy to the ground is centimeter-perfect.

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:50.375
So the sensors that we see over here, the Lidars and the cameras,

00:01:50.375 --> 00:01:53.910
are actually plugged in directly to the systems onboard.

00:01:53.910 --> 00:01:58.760
And, in addition to that, we have GPS, 4G, 3G, radio, and Wi-Fi,

00:01:58.760 --> 00:02:01.940
which connect wirelessly to networks around campus,

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:05.240
to aid its location positioning.

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:10.220
So the reason why we use quite a few technologies to aid its positioning

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:15.240
is so that, if one were to go down, we have quite a few backups.
