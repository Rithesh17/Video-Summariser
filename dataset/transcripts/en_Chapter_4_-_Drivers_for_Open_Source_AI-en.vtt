There are thousands of open source software projects supporting the responsible development of AI.

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:15.660
The use of open source is being driven by shared values among the open source and AI communities,

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:22.060
values like transparency, the growing skills gap, improved security, reduced costs and pace of innovation,

00:00:22.060 --> 00:00:25.440
and access to the massive datasets needed for training algorithms.

00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:31.640
These common principles make the open source and AI communities natural collaborators.
