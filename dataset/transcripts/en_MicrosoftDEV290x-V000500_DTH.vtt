00:00:01.460 --> 00:00:04.530
>> Image processing involves using tools

00:00:04.530 --> 00:00:07.020
and code to analyze and manipulate Images.

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:09.705
In Data Science and AI related projects,

00:00:09.705 --> 00:00:11.460
Python is the prevalent language

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:13.335
for working with data of all kinds.

00:00:13.335 --> 00:00:16.275
So how can we use Python to work with image data?

00:00:16.275 --> 00:00:18.780
Well, here's our image which to

00:00:18.780 --> 00:00:20.640
the computer software is represented as

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:23.195
a three-dimensional matrix of pixel values.

00:00:23.195 --> 00:00:26.610
In Python, Matplotlib is often

00:00:26.610 --> 00:00:28.230
the Ggplot2 package for dealing with

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:30.960
data visualizations like charts and plots,

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:34.710
but you can also use it to read write and display image files.

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:37.830
Then there's the Python Image Library or

00:00:37.830 --> 00:00:41.940
Pill and a particular a Fork of that package known as Pillow.

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:44.170
This package contains a library of

00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:46.255
useful Image Manipulation Functions

00:00:46.255 --> 00:00:49.820
that enable you to work with a wide range of image types.

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:54.100
OpenCV is another well-established library

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:57.260
for Python based Computer Vision Programming.

00:00:57.260 --> 00:01:00.430
Scikit-Image is yet another library

00:01:00.430 --> 00:01:02.230
that's particularly useful for applying

00:01:02.230 --> 00:01:04.240
statistical and mathematical functions

00:01:04.240 --> 00:01:07.220
to image data for analysis and modelling.

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:09.730
Now, you might use some or all of

00:01:09.730 --> 00:01:12.385
these packages for various image related tasks.

00:01:12.385 --> 00:01:16.105
But at the end of the day, an image is just an array of numbers.

00:01:16.105 --> 00:01:18.310
The NumPy Library is great

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:20.920
for working with numeric data structures.

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:25.110
In fact, it turns out that a NumPy array is

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:27.170
the perfect format to share image data

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:30.110
across all of the available image processing packages,

00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:32.600
and acts like a common currency that you can use to

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:35.050
exchange images between different libraries,

00:01:35.050 --> 00:01:38.670
so that you can use the specific functionality you need.
