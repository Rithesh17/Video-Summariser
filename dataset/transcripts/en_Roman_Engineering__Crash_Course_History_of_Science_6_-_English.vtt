00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:10.450
The Romans invented concrete over two thousands
years ago and built roads which are still

00:00:10.450 --> 00:00:11.450
around today.

00:00:11.450 --> 00:00:17.160
They used arches and domes to create monumental
buildings with big airy interiors that looked

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:19.720
truly Olympian—also still around.

00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:24.220
And they moved thousands of tons of water
using aqueducts to keep a bustling population

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:25.230
un-thirsty.

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:26.330
These old buildings?

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:27.359
Also still around!

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:30.500
But did the Romans come up with ideas
about physics?

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:34.530
Like why arches support weight differently
than right-angled structures?

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:39.540
Did they ask proto-chemistry questions—that
is, “what is stuff?”—such as which tiny

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:41.550
things make up a good concrete?

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:42.100
Nope.

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:46.020
Let’s look at what knowledge the Romans
made in order to set up a debate that, spoiler

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:50.750
alert, is still going on: do you understand
something when you can explain why it’s

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:52.340
true, in the abstract?

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:58.100
Or do you understand something when you can
do things with it, even if you can’t explain why?

00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:06.560
[Intro Music Plays]

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:09.220
The Romans inherited much of their knowledge from the Greeks.

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:14.720
From 323 to 31 BCE, the geometry, physics,
astronomy, and other disciplines developed

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:19.630
by the Presocratics, Plato, and Aristotle
spread throughout the Hellenistic world.

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:24.590
This “world” combined the parts of Asia,
Africa, and Europe influenced by Greek thought

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:28.160
due in large part to Alexander’s brief supervillain
rampage.

00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:32.999
In Alexandria, Egypt—the biggest of the
seventy cities that Alexander named after

00:01:32.999 --> 00:01:37.710
himself—the kings paid for the Museum, or
“house of the muses.”

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:42.130
This wasn’t a museum in the modern sense
of the word but more like a research university.

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:47.749
In Pergamon, in what is now Turkey, the kings
paid for the Library, which was—wait for

00:01:47.749 --> 00:01:49.719
it—a really big collection of books.

00:01:49.719 --> 00:01:53.659
These institutions lasted for centuries, drawing
visitors from far and wide.

00:01:53.659 --> 00:01:57.799
Alas, over the same period of time that these
Greeks were supporting research, a tribe from

00:01:57.799 --> 00:02:03.359
central Italy called the Romans went on a
new supervillain rampage… that also lasted

00:02:03.359 --> 00:02:04.359
for centuries.

00:02:04.359 --> 00:02:08.569
The Romans would continue to spread classical
Greek thought: we even call their culture

00:02:08.569 --> 00:02:09.569
“Greco-Roman.”

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:12.960
But natural philosophy during Greco-Roman
times didn’t advance much.

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:19.349
Today, we remember the Romans for their engineering—or
ability to improve some real-world system—not

00:02:19.349 --> 00:02:22.480
their deep thoughts about why the world is
the way it is.

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:24.940
Roman engineering built on Greek engineering.

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:30.180
Making knowledge is political, and most politicians
really want the same thing: bigger catapults

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:31.540
and lots of ships.

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:36.260
So Greco-Roman leaders did what heads of state
everywhere have always done: they paid smart

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:37.950
people to make bigger weapons.

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:44.019
In the ancient Mediterranean, the job of building
warmachines was called architecton, or architect.

00:02:44.019 --> 00:02:47.379
Most of these “architects” were anonymous
and didn’t write down theories.

00:02:47.379 --> 00:02:48.849
But, a few of them did.

00:02:48.849 --> 00:02:54.130
The most famous architecton, Archimedes of
Syracuse, fought for the Greeks against the

00:02:54.130 --> 00:02:55.130
Romans.

00:02:55.130 --> 00:02:59.459
Archimedes is famous today as a mathematician:
he worked out many geometrical proofs

00:02:59.459 --> 00:03:03.829
including the area of a circle, and pioneered
infinitesimals and exponents.

00:03:03.829 --> 00:03:09.989
Archimedes also invented a lot of useful contraptions,
including the water screw and compound pulley.

00:03:09.989 --> 00:03:13.750
The water screw pumps water by turning a screw
inside a pipe.

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:16.550
This was immediately useful in irrigation.

00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:20.049
And a mechanical way to move water uphill
is just plain cool!

00:03:20.049 --> 00:03:24.019
Archimedes also designed various warmachines
to kill the Romans who were trying to take

00:03:24.019 --> 00:03:25.019
over his hometown.

00:03:25.019 --> 00:03:29.809
He was so impressive that the Roman general
ordered his troops to capture, not kill, him.

00:03:29.809 --> 00:03:34.180
But one soldier particularly low on chill
got frustrated when Archimedes wouldn’t

00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:36.219
stop working on a mathematical proof.

00:03:36.219 --> 00:03:41.659
In a sense, Archimedes kept it so real that
he got himself and, symbolically, an era of

00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:42.940
Greek science killed.

00:03:43.020 --> 00:03:47.720
Archimedes was interested in some of the natural
philosophy that explained his machines, but

00:03:47.721 --> 00:03:53.569
for most other thinkers of his time, astronomy,
physics, and math were important for abstract,

00:03:53.569 --> 00:03:55.459
quasi-religious reasons.

00:03:55.459 --> 00:03:58.269
Making weapons was a matter of political power.

00:03:58.269 --> 00:04:02.019
The heavens from which rain fell were perfect
and abstract.

00:04:02.019 --> 00:04:05.530
Shipbuilding was an art, something learned
from practice.

00:04:05.530 --> 00:04:10.520
It was not a matter of understanding hydrodynamics,
or the chemical properties of wood that make

00:04:10.520 --> 00:04:11.520
it bendy and floaty.

00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:15.980
Aristotle came up with a handy division between
these types of knowledge that we still use today.

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:19.980
He classified knowledge as either “useful”
or “theoretical.”

00:04:19.980 --> 00:04:23.560
Useful knowledge was called technē, which
is where we get “technology.”

00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:29.259
“Technology” has until recently, in historical
terms, been connected to the idea of “art”—meaning

00:04:29.259 --> 00:04:33.150
something you learn by doing, and can see
in the real world.

00:04:33.150 --> 00:04:37.400
Theoretical knowledge, on the other hand,
was epistēmē—the root of our word epistemology,

00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:38.810
the study of knowledge.

00:04:38.810 --> 00:04:42.789
Epistēmē is the sort of knowledge we most
associate with “science.”

00:04:42.789 --> 00:04:45.410
Science is abstract, represented by formulas.

00:04:45.410 --> 00:04:49.870
When historians of science talk about the
possibilities of what we can know, they use

00:04:49.870 --> 00:04:50.870
the word “epistemic.”

00:04:50.870 --> 00:04:54.620
One of the most influential thinkers working
on epistemic questions during the Greco-Roman

00:04:54.620 --> 00:05:01.530
period was Claudius Ptolemy, a Greek or Greek-speaking
southern Egyptian living in Roman-held Alexandria.

00:05:01.530 --> 00:05:05.740
In addition to optics and the science of music,
Ptolemy took up Plato’s old problem of how

00:05:05.740 --> 00:05:11.710
to fit the observed data about how the planets
move to the theory of a cosmos made of perfect

00:05:11.710 --> 00:05:14.000
circles with earth at its center.

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:18.720
He got really, really into this, mixing together
three kinds of solutions in order to make

00:05:18.720 --> 00:05:24.050
the math work: epicycles, for example, were
the tiny circles that the planets moved along…

00:05:24.050 --> 00:05:25.500
around bigger circles.

00:05:25.500 --> 00:05:30.130
Ptolemy’s version of the cosmos, a mathematically
neater version of Aristotle’s and Plato’s,

00:05:30.130 --> 00:05:34.780
became the basis of the understanding of the
universe across much of the medieval Christian

00:05:34.780 --> 00:05:36.120
and Islamic world.

00:05:36.120 --> 00:05:40.979
His great astronomical work, the Mathematical
Syntaxis, was renamed by Arabic scholars as

00:05:40.979 --> 00:05:43.510
the Almagest, or The Greatest.

00:05:43.510 --> 00:05:48.000
Fun fact: the Almagest may have been edited
by one of the first recorded female natural

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:50.100
philosophers, Hypatia of Alexandria.

00:05:50.100 --> 00:05:54.040
So we’re on episode six of History of Science and, yes,
this is the first mention of a woman...

00:05:54.060 --> 00:05:59.800
Ptolemy was also pretty much the authority
on earthly geography in the Greco-Roman world.

00:05:59.800 --> 00:06:04.620
His book on the subject, called Geography,
discusses the data he uses and why.

00:06:04.629 --> 00:06:08.960
It provided a resource for other scholars
to use in more accurately picturing and drawing

00:06:08.960 --> 00:06:10.620
the world, for centuries.

00:06:10.620 --> 00:06:14.090
Oh, and none of these thinkers thought that
the earth was flat.

00:06:14.090 --> 00:06:17.900
Flat earth theory may have more proponents
today than it did in Greco-Roman times.

00:06:17.920 --> 00:06:22.160
As Ptolemy shows, epistemic work was important
to a few Greco-Romans.

00:06:22.160 --> 00:06:25.789
But what they’re really remembered for is
their technē, their engineering.

00:06:25.789 --> 00:06:29.669
For example, people had been mixing together
water and rocks to make cement for generations.

00:06:29.669 --> 00:06:36.030
But by 150 BCE, the Romans began mixing volcanic
ash, rocks, water, and lime to make Roman

00:06:36.030 --> 00:06:41.211
concrete, or opus caementitium, which is one
of those technologies that the smarty-pants like

00:06:41.211 --> 00:06:43.379
to call "a big freakin' deal.”

00:06:43.379 --> 00:06:48.410
This new stuff was super durable and could
be poured into weird shapes like domes.

00:06:48.410 --> 00:06:54.819
The Pantheon or Really Big Temple in Rome
is capped by a 143-foot diameter dome of concrete

00:06:54.820 --> 00:06:57.120
that has stood for almost two thousand years.

00:06:57.180 --> 00:07:01.340
But the Romans found out that arches support
more weight than straight joints.

00:07:01.340 --> 00:07:04.699
This matters when you’re trying to move
something really heavy, like water.

00:07:04.699 --> 00:07:09.919
Thus the Romans were able to move water long
distances using arch-y aqueducts.

00:07:09.919 --> 00:07:14.199
This in turn allowed Roman cities to grow
in population, mines to run, and dry lands

00:07:14.199 --> 00:07:15.199
to be irrigated.

00:07:15.199 --> 00:07:18.860
The Romans changed their lands in other ways,
too: they drained the marshes of their home

00:07:18.860 --> 00:07:24.729
city using an innovative sewer system called
the Cloaca Maxima, which literally means “Biggest

00:07:24.729 --> 00:07:25.800
Sewer.”

00:07:25.800 --> 00:07:26.800
Great name, my dudes.

00:07:26.800 --> 00:07:31.819
The politician and civil engineer Sextus Julius
Frontinus wrote a landmark, comprehensive,

00:07:31.819 --> 00:07:37.289
two-volume report on the design for the aqueducts
and sewers of Rome… which luckily a Renaissance

00:07:37.289 --> 00:07:41.759
scholar found a copy of, just as the city
recovered from a roughly one thousand year

00:07:41.759 --> 00:07:43.030
downturn in population.

00:07:43.030 --> 00:07:47.360
Yes, that’s right: Roman infrastructural
engineering lasted through a millennium of

00:07:47.360 --> 00:07:49.500
neglect and still worked!

00:07:49.500 --> 00:07:55.229
But as great as gigantic open rooms, fresh
drinking water, and big-big sewers are, the

00:07:55.229 --> 00:07:58.580
most important feat of Roman engineering may
have been their highways.

00:07:58.580 --> 00:08:00.910
We hear a lot about “infrastructure” today.

00:08:00.910 --> 00:08:04.280
And states have always made roads to foster
trade and move troops.

00:08:04.280 --> 00:08:08.580
But Roman road builders took the art of logistics
to another level.

00:08:08.580 --> 00:08:11.629
Show us what a big deal this was, Thought
Bubble!

00:08:11.629 --> 00:08:16.979
Consider the Appian Way: running from Rome
southeast through the “heel” of Italy,

00:08:16.979 --> 00:08:21.560
it connected several not very urbanized regions
of the peninsula.

00:08:21.560 --> 00:08:26.370
Its first leg was built in 312 BCE—before
Roman concrete was perfected...

00:08:26.370 --> 00:08:29.660
...using cement over layers of fitted stones
and gravel.

00:08:29.660 --> 00:08:33.849
Drainage ditches lined its sides, and the
road was cambered to allow water to drain

00:08:33.849 --> 00:08:34.849
off.

00:08:34.849 --> 00:08:39.029
The Appian Way allowed Roman troops to efficiently
crush their enemies.

00:08:39.029 --> 00:08:41.070
It was expanded over the centuries.

00:08:41.070 --> 00:08:43.450
And the Appian Way is still around!

00:08:43.450 --> 00:08:48.170
The cement has eroded away, but you can still
see many long, very straight sections.

00:08:48.170 --> 00:08:52.500
It’s lined by trees, marked by monuments,
and haunted by history.

00:08:52.500 --> 00:08:57.029
And the Appian Way is only one of several
well-preserved, two-thousand-year-old Roman

00:08:57.029 --> 00:09:00.360
roads crisscrossing Africa, Asia, and Europe.

00:09:00.360 --> 00:09:03.140
Metaphorically, all of these roads led to
Rome.

00:09:03.140 --> 00:09:07.550
Her citizens paid taxes toward many large-scale
public works such as highways.

00:09:07.550 --> 00:09:12.470
Perhaps the most important technology the
Romans optimized was the state itself: they

00:09:12.470 --> 00:09:18.240
developed a complicated legal system, a well-supplied
army, public food assistance, and massive

00:09:18.240 --> 00:09:19.280
public games.

00:09:19.280 --> 00:09:24.370
One site of these games was the Flavian Amphitheater,
AKA the Colosseum.

00:09:24.370 --> 00:09:29.090
It had a retractable roof that was staffed
by sailors who used complicated rigging to

00:09:29.090 --> 00:09:35.180
move the canvas coverings around, and it was
sometimes flooded to allow for naval war games.

00:09:35.180 --> 00:09:38.990
How many engineers today know how to properly
rig a giant sun-sail?

00:09:38.990 --> 00:09:42.850
Or safely flood a public venue—without using
plastic?

00:09:42.850 --> 00:09:48.339
Thanks, Thought Bubble, but these public works
were intended for Romans, not their property…

00:09:48.339 --> 00:09:52.660
Before the industrial revolution, public works
such as aqueducts, sewers, and roads required

00:09:52.660 --> 00:09:57.130
quarrying lots of materials and lots and lots
of labor.

00:09:57.130 --> 00:09:59.380
And “labor” meant slaves.

00:09:59.380 --> 00:10:03.550
Some estimates hold that one in three people
in Roman Italy were enslaved.

00:10:03.550 --> 00:10:08.590
These people were involved in knowledge creation,
if against their will, by building and maintaining

00:10:08.590 --> 00:10:11.160
all those great roads and other structures.

00:10:11.160 --> 00:10:15.560
Roman slavery was a little different than
plantation slavery in the American South.

00:10:15.560 --> 00:10:17.480
Slaves could be highly educated.

00:10:17.480 --> 00:10:19.200
Many physicians were even slaves.

00:10:19.200 --> 00:10:21.960
They could buy their freedom and become voting
citizens.

00:10:21.960 --> 00:10:24.780
But most remained chattel—meaning property.

00:10:24.780 --> 00:10:29.880
In 73 BCE, the gladiator Spartacus famously
led a slave revolt in Italy.

00:10:29.880 --> 00:10:34.130
The freed slaves fought the army for two years,
but they were eventually defeated.

00:10:34.130 --> 00:10:39.240
The survivors of the rebellion were crucified
along the Appian Way, from Rome to Capua,

00:10:39.240 --> 00:10:41.279
over a hundred miles to the south.

00:10:41.279 --> 00:10:44.410
Brutal story, but worth telling in the context
of Roman engineering.

00:10:44.410 --> 00:10:49.850
Because the technologies that engineers make
are, like the sciences, political—only as

00:10:49.850 --> 00:10:52.260
good or as bad as the humans who use them.

00:10:52.260 --> 00:10:57.660
Roman thinkers left behind written sources
including histories, plays, proto-novels,

00:10:57.670 --> 00:10:59.320
poems, legal manuals, and religious texts.

00:10:59.320 --> 00:11:02.610
But only a few Roman texts deal with natural
philosophy.

00:11:02.610 --> 00:11:05.730
Frontius’s guide to aqueducts was one exception.

00:11:05.730 --> 00:11:07.970
Another was the Architecture of Vitruvius.

00:11:07.970 --> 00:11:12.649
He wrote about buildings, but also urban planning
and even the plan of the human body.

00:11:12.649 --> 00:11:17.180
By linking the limbs of the human body to
mathematical principles, Vitruvius inspired

00:11:17.180 --> 00:11:18.930
Da Vinci’s “Vitruvian man.”

00:11:18.930 --> 00:11:23.330
Vitruvius’s Architecture sums up the concepts
about knowledge common to the Hellenistic

00:11:23.330 --> 00:11:28.899
and Greco-Roman worlds: it’s a technical
manual also concerned with the beautiful harmonies

00:11:28.899 --> 00:11:34.190
of form inherent to bodies as well as the
efficient management of cities—the “body

00:11:34.190 --> 00:11:35.190
politic.”

00:11:35.190 --> 00:11:39.209
Next time—we’ll meet mechanical wonders
and the wonder of public healthcare in the

00:11:39.209 --> 00:11:42.360
Abbasid Caliphate’s great capital, Baghdad.

00:11:42.360 --> 00:11:46.639
Crash Course History of Science is filmed
in the Dr. Cheryl C. Kinney studio in Missoula,

00:11:46.639 --> 00:11:50.760
Montana and it’s made with the help of all
this nice people and our animation team is

00:11:50.760 --> 00:11:51.760
Thought Cafe.

00:11:51.760 --> 00:11:53.240
Crash Course is a Complexly production.
