00:00:03.180 --> 00:00:08.140
From the earliest steam machines to modern
muscle cars, engines have long powered engineering.

00:00:08.140 --> 00:00:10.500
I mean, the field is literally named after
them.

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:17.000
Engines provide us with energy we can use for
all kinds of things, and how to optimize them is
one of engineering’s central problems.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:24.640
One of the keys to solving it is the concept of
reversibility: the more reversible a system is, the
less work it needs from its surroundings.

00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:27.640
In other words, a more reversible system needs
less fuel to keep going.

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:32.660
So if you’re trying to build the best engine
you can, reversibility is a good place to start.

00:00:32.660 --> 00:00:42.960
[Theme Music]

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:46.800
Engines drive our society and many of the
machines we use every day.

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:49.140
And what’s inside many of our engines, are
pistons.

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:54.860
Pistons are disks or cylindrical parts that
move back and forth in a cylinder against
a liquid or a gas.

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:58.760
In an internal combustion engine, like the
one that’s under the hood of most cars,

00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:04.980
the pistons are pushed by the expanding gases in
the cylinder, which turns a type of shaft or wheel.

00:01:04.980 --> 00:01:09.540
This turns their repetitive, linear motion
into a rotation that helps power the engine.

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:18.160
When you’re dealing with a simple machine or
mechanism, like a piston, there are two main types
of energy you can put into or take out of the system:
heat and work.

00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:22.860
You probably have a pretty good idea of what heat is.
Simply put, it’s thermal energy.

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:26.780
It’s what you feel when you step out in
the sun or stand by a warm fire.

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:29.380
In engineering, we define heat with the letter
Q.

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:32.840
Work, represented by the letter W, is a little
more complex.

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:37.600
It’s essentially any type of energy other
than heat that crosses into a system.

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:41.720
One way to measure it is by how much force
is being applied over a distance.

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:46.620
There are a different types of work you’re likely
to encounter as an engineer, but with all of them,

00:01:46.620 --> 00:01:53.660
the idea is that by putting work into a system,
you can get some work out of it, usually in a more
useful form.

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:56.000
One type is pressure-volume work.

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:58.980
This has to do with the expansion and compression
of matter.

00:01:58.980 --> 00:02:01.560
Squeezing a stress ball is a good example.

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:07.580
Based on how much pressure you apply to the
ball, the change in volume tells you how much
work you were able to achieve.

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:13.380
When the stress ball is expanded, we’d say the
work is negative, because it’s being done by the ball.

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:17.960
When it’s compressed, the work is positive,
because it’s being done on the ball.

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:20.000
Pistons involve pressure-volume work, too.

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:26.540
In a car, for example, the work done on the
system comes from the fuel, which heats up
gas in the cylinder when it’s ignited.

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:31.020
As the gas expands, it does work, with the
increased pressure pushing the piston up.

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:34.250
Then the gas cools again and the piston moves
back down.

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:37.110
This cycle produces work that turns the shaft
or wheel.

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:43.020
Another type of work is shaft work, which
is when a shaft or propeller rotates through
a liquid or gas.

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:48.560
There’s also electrical work, which is the work
done on a charged particle by an electric field.

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:51.020
You can think of it like the discharge from
a battery.

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:55.620
As you’re watching this video, there's electrical
work going on in your phone or computer.

00:02:55.620 --> 00:03:02.920
A lot of engineering is about optimizing your
machines and processes to produce the most
amount of work with as little input as possible.

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:07.620
The more work a machine uses up, the more you
need to get out of it, to have it be worth your while.

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:11.880
It’s like a job; the more time and effort you put in,
the more you’ll want to get paid.

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:13.980
That’s why work is well...work.

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:17.380
With machines, optimizing work is all about
reversibility.

00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:21.260
You’ll never get more energy out of a system
than what was put into it.

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:23.200
That would violate conservation of energy.

00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:29.640
But if a process is reversible, that means
it can go back to its initial state and start
over with no additional work input.

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:35.040
In other words, when a process is reversible,
you’re maximizing the amount of work you
get for your input.

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:38.080
But reversible processes are impossible in
real life.

00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:41.460
They require slow, steady, incredibly small changes

00:03:41.460 --> 00:03:47.240
to make sure you don’t permanently change the
system in a way that you can’t reverse without
putting some additional work in.

00:03:47.240 --> 00:03:49.860
Which...would require an infinite amount of
time.

00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:54.120
So in the real world, all processes involving
work are irreversible.

00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:59.260
They can be reset, to some extent, but you
need to put in a bit of elbow grease to get
them there.

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:05.120
A reversible process is more like the
best-case scenario – one you can get close to,
but never actually reach.

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:10.960
In engineering, it’s not so much about whether
a process is reversible, but how reversible it is.

00:04:10.960 --> 00:04:15.760
The closer you can get to reversibility, the
more efficient and optimal the process will be.

00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:18.120
To see what I mean, let’s go back to that
piston.

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:22.540
You want the piston to move up and down in
the cylinder, to turn a crank, and generate power.

00:04:22.540 --> 00:04:24.200
There’s also gas in the cylinder.

00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:28.820
Bringing the piston up expands the gas and
pushing it down compresses the gas.

00:04:28.820 --> 00:04:32.000
When the gas is under compression, it will
expand on its own.

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:34.980
But it won’t compress again unless a force
is applied to it.

00:04:34.980 --> 00:04:39.880
It’s like the stress ball – after you squeeze it,
it will expand back to its original size.

00:04:39.880 --> 00:04:44.000
But the ball won’t randomly crumble back
in on itself without an outside force.

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:49.000
Say this piston is designed so the force compressing
the piston comes from a brick.

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:53.840
When you remove the brick, the gas below
the piston will expand will expand freely, and
the piston will rise.

00:04:53.840 --> 00:05:00.960
But to get the gas to compress again and the
piston to go back down, you need to lift the brick
to put it back on top of the piston.

00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:07.380
Since the system needs outside work to get it
back to where it was, with the gas compressed,
this process is irreversible.

00:05:07.380 --> 00:05:10.360
Next, let’s say you trying to break the
brick in two.

00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:14.580
The system starts out like before, with the
gas compressed by the weight of a full brick.

00:05:14.580 --> 00:05:20.320
Then you remove one half-brick, leaving it
right where the piston was, near the bottom
of the cylinder.

00:05:20.320 --> 00:05:26.680
The gas still expands, but it doesn’t push the
piston as far, since there’s still half a brick’s
worth of weight holding it down.

00:05:26.680 --> 00:05:32.940
Then you remove the other half-brick, and like the
first one, you leave it at the same height, let’s say on
a shelf right next to the piston or something.

00:05:32.940 --> 00:05:38.620
This allows the gas to expand as much as it
did when you were using one brick, pushing
the piston all the way up.

00:05:38.620 --> 00:05:43.660
But, think about the amount of work it will
take to reverse this process and get the piston
to go back down.

00:05:43.660 --> 00:05:49.960
Before, you had to lift the entire brick all the way
from where the piston started to where it stopped
when the gas was done expanding.

00:05:49.980 --> 00:05:55.340
But this time, half the brick is already part
of the way up the cylinder, because that’s
where you removed it.

00:05:55.340 --> 00:06:02.220
So you start by lifting that half-brick up to
the top, which compresses the gas and pushes
the piston part of the way down.

00:06:02.220 --> 00:06:08.460
Then, you lift the other half-brick to where
the piston is now, pushing the piston down
all the way back to where it started.

00:06:08.460 --> 00:06:15.460
So, instead of having to lift the whole brick all the
way up the piston, now you effectively only have to
lift half a brick all the way up the piston;

00:06:15.460 --> 00:06:17.720
it just took two steps instead of one.

00:06:17.720 --> 00:06:22.680
That’s a lot less work, which means the
process is that much less irreversible than
it was with one brick.

00:06:22.680 --> 00:06:25.760
And now you can start problem-solving as an
engineer.

00:06:25.760 --> 00:06:30.860
If breaking the brick in two makes the process
more reversible, how can you make it even better?

00:06:30.860 --> 00:06:34.620
A simple answer is to keep breaking the brick
into smaller and smaller pieces.

00:06:34.620 --> 00:06:37.530
Eventually, you’d turn it into infinitely
tiny grains of sand.

00:06:37.530 --> 00:06:42.720
This time, you start with a pile of sand with
the same weight as the full brick, pushing
the piston down.

00:06:42.720 --> 00:06:48.620
Then you remove one grain of sand at a time,
leaving each grain at the same height that the
piston was when you removed it.

00:06:48.630 --> 00:06:51.080
Gradually, the piston rises, producing work.

00:06:51.080 --> 00:06:59.460
But each movement is so small that to reverse
the process and move the piston down, all you really
have to do is shift each grain of sand sideways.

00:06:59.460 --> 00:07:05.150
Remember, we’re talking about increments
that are infinitely small, so you effectively
aren’t lifting anything.

00:07:05.150 --> 00:07:09.960
You can keep the shifting grains of sand sideways,
and slowly, the weight on the piston will increase,

00:07:09.960 --> 00:07:13.140
compressing the gas and bringing you
right back to where you started.

00:07:13.140 --> 00:07:17.540
Which is definitely less work than lifting
a whole brick, or even a half brick.

00:07:17.540 --> 00:07:21.160
In fact, apart from that one grain you’ve
lifted from the bottom to the top,

00:07:21.160 --> 00:07:28.240
the amount of work required to put each grain of
sand back on the piston is exactly the same as the
work ‘produced’ when you take it off.

00:07:28.240 --> 00:07:36.340
Everything is happening so slowly and gradually that
you aren’t losing energy as heat, which means you
don’t need to ‘add’ work to replace that lost energy.

00:07:36.340 --> 00:07:40.280
So you don’t need to put in any external
work to push the piston back down,

00:07:40.280 --> 00:07:44.900
and you can use the same amount of work
produced by the system to get it right back to
where it started.

00:07:44.900 --> 00:07:47.440
And there you have it: a reversible process.

00:07:47.440 --> 00:07:50.920
Again, this would be pretty much impossible
to accomplish in real life.

00:07:50.920 --> 00:07:55.240
For one thing, you can’t actually have infinitely
tiny grains of sand.

00:07:55.240 --> 00:07:57.840
Even a single molecule isn’t infinitely
tiny.

00:07:57.840 --> 00:08:02.620
Plus, you’d need an infinite amount of time
to get through all these infinitely small steps.

00:08:02.620 --> 00:08:06.740
But as you break the brick into smaller pieces,
you can get closer and closer.

00:08:06.740 --> 00:08:10.580
It’s also worth noting that the closer you
get to the reversible version of this process,

00:08:10.580 --> 00:08:14.500
the longer it will take, which would not be
useful for most applications.

00:08:14.500 --> 00:08:18.360
If this type of piston was in the engine of
your car, you’d be better off walking.

00:08:18.360 --> 00:08:23.980
So reversibility sounds good, but you need
to work with irreversible systems if you really
want to achieve something.

00:08:23.980 --> 00:08:28.500
As an engineer, the goal is to figure out how
close you can get a system to being reversible,

00:08:28.500 --> 00:08:31.680
while still keeping it time, effort, and cost
effective.

00:08:31.680 --> 00:08:33.260
Which brings us to efficiency.

00:08:33.260 --> 00:08:39.280
In general, the efficiency of any system is
the ratio of what you get out of it, compared
to what you have to put into it.

00:08:39.280 --> 00:08:45.240
It’ll have a value ranging from 0% to 100%,
with 100% being maximum efficiency.

00:08:45.240 --> 00:08:50.040
In this case, efficiency helps quantify how
close a system is to perfectly reversible.

00:08:50.040 --> 00:08:52.780
It’s the amount of work produced by
the system you’re looking at,

00:08:52.780 --> 00:08:58.500
as a percentage of the amount of work that
would be produced by the ideal — but impossible
— reversible system.

00:08:58.500 --> 00:09:00.820
The result is η, the efficiency.

00:09:00.820 --> 00:09:05.340
If something is 100% efficient, that means
it’s a completely reversible system.

00:09:05.340 --> 00:09:08.770
If it has 0 efficiency, it’s totally
irreversible.

00:09:08.770 --> 00:09:12.460
You can see how important efficiency is by
going back to cars and engines.

00:09:12.460 --> 00:09:18.590
The more efficient your vehicle is, the more
energy you can get out of your fuel, and the
farther you can go on a tank of gas.

00:09:18.590 --> 00:09:22.820
That’s why you’ll want to keep efficiency
relatively high in most engineering systems.

00:09:22.820 --> 00:09:28.700
It’s especially important whenever you
want to sustain a process for a long time,
like a cross-country road trip.

00:09:28.700 --> 00:09:32.700
But sometimes you’ll need to sacrifice efficiency
to accomplish your goals.

00:09:32.700 --> 00:09:37.660
You might need to put a lot of work into a
system to do something quickly or get a big output.

00:09:37.660 --> 00:09:39.000
Think of a drag race.

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:44.620
Converting between types of energy might also be
more important than getting a big output for your input,

00:09:44.620 --> 00:09:49.020
like turning a hand crank to get a small amount
of electricity when the power is out.

00:09:49.020 --> 00:09:52.820
In these situations, converting energy might
be worth the low efficiency.

00:09:52.820 --> 00:09:54.480
Engineering is all about trade-offs.

00:09:54.480 --> 00:09:59.180
It’s awesome when you can have great
marks all around, but that’s probably not
going to happen very often.

00:09:59.180 --> 00:10:04.520
In today’s lesson, we learned all about how to
design the most efficient machines and processes.

00:10:04.520 --> 00:10:08.720
We began by going over heat and work: the
two main types of energy.

00:10:08.720 --> 00:10:15.780
We then moved on to reversibility and
irreversibility and found that most processes
are somewhat irreversible in nature.

00:10:15.780 --> 00:10:21.860
Putting all of this together, we worked through
a problem with a piston and learned how to use
efficiency to measure a system.

00:10:21.860 --> 00:10:28.200
I’ll see you next time, when we’ll learn
about the first law of thermodynamics and the
conversation will really heat up.

00:10:28.200 --> 00:10:32.480
