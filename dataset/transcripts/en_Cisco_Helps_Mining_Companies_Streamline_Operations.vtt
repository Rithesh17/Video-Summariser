00:00:01.860 --> 00:00:03.870
SPEAKER 1: Today's mining operations comprise

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:06.630
a series of disparate siloed environments,

00:00:06.630 --> 00:00:12.420
from extraction and automation systems to port and rail and track automation.

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:14.910
Each environment presents its own challenges

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:20.670
and mainly operates independently using proprietary data sources and networks.

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:24.030
You need a holistic view of your entire mining operations

00:00:24.030 --> 00:00:26.700
that leads to better visibility and traceability

00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:29.070
while letting you take advantage of rich IP

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:32.310
enabled technologies in each environment.

00:00:32.310 --> 00:00:36.240
Working with industry leading partners, Cisco can help fully connect

00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:38.910
and integrate all of your operational environments,

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:43.440
removing the barriers to efficiency created by siloed networks.

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:45.690
But it doesn't stop there.

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:49.920
Cisco takes an integrated approach, converging your existing enterprise

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:56.010
systems with this new consolidated operational technology, or OT network.

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:59.910
The result is a fully connected and converged pit-to-port network

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:03.180
that enables lean, efficient, collaborative, safe, and highly

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:09.330
secure operations while helping you keep your costs down and your profits up.

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:13.980
With Cisco Solutions for Mining, you can improve performance and efficiency

00:01:13.980 --> 00:01:19.590
at all stages of operations to reduce downtime, better manage and schedule

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:24.480
your fleet and assets, wherever or whatever they may be,

00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:30.150
increase security to control access to restricted areas and your assets,

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:32.840
and most importantly, better ensure the safety of both

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:36.020
your employees and the environment.

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:39.410
And you can do all of this while connecting your teams and assets

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:42.350
collaboratively around the world.

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:44.630
Here are just a few examples.

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:47.720
In mining operations, downtime is the enemy,

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:52.040
and an idle truck can cost hundreds of thousands per day.

00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:56.630
Cisco Solutions for Mining help automate operations for maximum efficiency

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:58.970
by leveraging the Internet of Things, where

00:01:58.970 --> 00:02:04.040
every device interacts with each other and turns information into action.

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:07.970
That means critical elements on a truck, from engine components to tire

00:02:07.970 --> 00:02:11.360
pressure, can be monitored both onboard and remotely,

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:13.980
enabling predictive maintenance.

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:17.120
Cab sensors monitor drivers for alertness,

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:19.790
and should a driver become tired, automatically

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:23.690
notify both the driver and a remote operation center.

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:27.740
Monitors can also remotely alert vehicles approaching a pit too quickly,

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:32.780
helping to ensure the safety of the driver and others working in the pit.

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:37.010
Real-time remote monitoring and scheduling of all machines and vehicles

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:40.360
is possible at every operation phase, from excavation,

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:43.810
to raw material movement, to delivery.

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:48.200
Cisco's Solutions for Mining also help to create a zero-harm environment

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:51.530
for personnel and surrounding areas.

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:55.940
This includes using RFID tags to track miners and machinery underground

00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:58.340
at all times.

00:02:58.340 --> 00:03:03.560
If there's an incident, each worker can be located in minutes.

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:08.480
Similarly, gas monitor systems help enable remote real-time gas detection,

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:13.460
so personnel and responders can be alerted to up to the minute conditions.

00:03:13.460 --> 00:03:16.700
Even with mining operations located in remote areas,

00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:20.660
malicious attacks can still occur at any time.

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:24.510
Cisco Solutions for Mining add both physical and cyber security

00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:28.130
to your infrastructure, helping to protect your operations and assets

00:03:28.130 --> 00:03:31.820
from both internal and external threats.

00:03:31.820 --> 00:03:36.140
And Cisco Solutions for Mining let the mining operators remotely collaborate

00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:40.250
on ideas and solutions with your office personnel, outside maintenance crews,

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:43.910
and third party engineering companies from around the world without ever

00:03:43.910 --> 00:03:46.250
leaving the site.
