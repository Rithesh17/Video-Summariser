00:00:02.960 --> 00:00:06.850
IAN HOWARD: I come to this research area, or Internet of Things area,

00:00:06.850 --> 00:00:09.920
from the point of view of rotating equipment.

00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:14.140
So if we think about industry, there's all kinds of pumps, compressors,

00:00:14.140 --> 00:00:16.930
turbines, gearboxes, and bore mills.

00:00:16.930 --> 00:00:21.400
The amount of rotating machinery that we have is really very vast.

00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:24.820
How do you actually know when things need maintaining?

00:00:24.820 --> 00:00:31.060
You either work on a time schedule basis, but if you try to save money

00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:34.660
and trying to do maintenance smarter, then really what you should be doing

00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:38.980
is on a predictive condition monitoring basis.

00:00:38.980 --> 00:00:42.430
That requires the use of sensors.

00:00:42.430 --> 00:00:46.880
Sensors that actually measure the behavior of the equipment.

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:49.720
And you want to be able to transmit that information,

00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:53.440
communicate that information, back to the web or to the internet

00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:57.100
and then be able to analyze that and be able to use

00:00:57.100 --> 00:01:00.130
that to understand what is happening.

00:01:00.130 --> 00:01:03.840
So wind turbines designed to last more than 20 years

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:06.310
but it needs to be maintained well.

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:10.240
In the earlier days, the wind turbines, well, the maintenance procedures,

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:13.130
would be on a time schedule basis.

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:16.960
What we have now is the ability to actually continuously monitor

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:19.300
the system in real time.

00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:22.930
Then it's only when something is in need of replacement

00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:25.320
that you actually do the replacement.

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:29.170
Let's say that the wind turbine suffers a lightning strike.

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:31.890
And the lightning propagates through the blade

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:35.200
and because the blade is a composite fiber material,

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:37.990
it's possible that the lightning strike could actually introduce

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:41.060
some delamination in the blade.

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:44.060
So, if you have vibration sensors on the blade,

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:46.720
you have strain gage sensors on the blade for example,

00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:49.360
then in real time you're able to detect, OK there's

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:52.370
actually been a change in operating condition now.

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:56.050
And then over time you can monitor that change and can progress.

00:01:56.050 --> 00:01:58.960
That change can progress.

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:04.990
So it's vitally important that before that portion of a blade flies off,

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:08.229
travels hundreds of meters potentially killing somebody,

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:11.530
that you actually stop the turbine, replace the blade.

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:14.650
The same thing for the bearings in the gearbox, for example.

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:19.000
Wind turbines have a history of burning down.

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:24.520
Which sounds very weird, but you can see evidence of wind turbines

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:27.280
burning because the bearings in the gears

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:33.190
get so damaged that they just heat up so much and that the oil starts to burn

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:37.300
and the whole thing literally burns down.

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:41.470
By monitoring the bearing condition and the gearbox condition then

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:45.640
you can actually alert the maintainers, the operators,

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:48.400
that something needs to be fixed.

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:54.070
And you can actually predict weeks and weeks, sometimes months in advance,

00:02:54.070 --> 00:02:56.140
when it needs to be maintained.

00:02:56.140 --> 00:03:00.790
I've got a PhD student looking at asset tracking in the health sector

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:03.280
and there's different opportunities there

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:05.950
in hospitals as well as in age care.

00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:07.390
They might be aware.

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:13.570
OK, they already have like 500 chairs for patients

00:03:13.570 --> 00:03:16.740
to use, for visitors to use.

00:03:16.740 --> 00:03:19.570
They know they have them-- they purchased them--

00:03:19.570 --> 00:03:23.410
but then you ask them, OK, where are those chairs?

00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:25.900
They actually don't know.

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:27.970
At any particular point in time, at the moment,

00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:32.920
they're not able to tell you where their assets are.

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:39.850
That led us to do some research into the various means of asset tracking,

00:03:39.850 --> 00:03:45.070
using smart tags for example, which can connect

00:03:45.070 --> 00:03:54.040
to Wi-Fi devices, Bluetooth devices, or LoRaWAN devices.

00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:57.080
So that's some research that's currently going on.

00:03:57.080 --> 00:04:01.240
Asset tracking has added benefits because if you

00:04:01.240 --> 00:04:04.810
can develop a smart tag on the asset, the smart tag

00:04:04.810 --> 00:04:09.020
itself can have sensors inbuilt in the asset.

00:04:09.020 --> 00:04:13.060
So now you have an asset, which has a tag on there,

00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:16.570
and you also have sensors on the tag.

00:04:16.570 --> 00:04:19.720
That can be embedded in the asset so that not only do you

00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:24.760
know where the asset is but you can do some condition monitoring or patient

00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:26.200
monitoring.

00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:32.670
So you can actually introduce the concept of patient quality care

00:04:32.670 --> 00:04:35.190
into the asset itself.
