00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:04.890
in this video let's delve deeper and get

00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:07.230
even better intuition about what the

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:08.580
cost function is doing this video

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:11.190
assumes that you're familiar with

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:13.710
contour plots if you're not familiar

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:16.080
with contour plots or contour figures

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:18.000
some of the illustrations in this video

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:20.010
may or may not make sense to you but

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.960
it's okay and if you end up skipping

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:23.189
this video or if some of it doesn't

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:25.740
quite make sense because you haven't

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:27.240
seen contour plots before that's okay

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:30.890
and you still understand the rest of

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:30.890
this course without those parts of it

00:00:31.340 --> 00:00:36.239
here's our problem formulation as usual

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:40.040
with the hypothesis parameters cost

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:42.870
function and our optimization objective

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:44.579
unlike before unlike the last video I'm

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:47.520
going to keep both of my parameters

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:50.820
theta 0 and theta 1 as we generate our

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:53.520
visualizations for the cost function so

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:57.170
same as last time we want to understand

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:59.789
the hypothesis H and the cost function J

00:00:57.170 --> 00:01:03.180
so here's my training set of housing

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:04.979
prices and let's make some hypothesis

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:07.650
you know like that one this is not a

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:11.250
particularly good hypothesis but if I

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:14.640
set theta 0 equals 50 and theta one

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:16.650
equals 0.06 then I end up with this

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:19.350
hypothesis down here and that

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:21.150
corresponds to that straight line now

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:22.979
given these values of theta zero and

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:25.500
theta one we want to plot the

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:28.680
corresponding you know cost function on

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:31.619
the right what we did last time was

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:33.090
regular where we only had theta one you

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:35.640
know we're drawing plots that look like

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:37.710
this as a function of theta one but now

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:40.290
we have two parameters theta zero and

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:43.020
theta one and so the plot gets a little

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:45.270
more complicated it turns out that when

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:46.979
we have only one parameter the plus we

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:50.340
drew had this sort of bow shaped

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:52.829
function now when we have two parameters

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:55.229
it turns out the cost function also has

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:57.479
a similar sort of bow shape and in fact

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:59.009
depending on your training set you might

00:01:57.479 --> 00:02:02.100
get a cost function that maybe looks

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:05.509
something like this so this is a 3d

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:08.340
surface plot where the axes are labeled

00:02:05.509 --> 00:02:11.730
theta 0 and theta

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:14.069
one so as you vary theta zero and theta

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:16.200
one to two parameters you get different

00:02:14.069 --> 00:02:19.680
values of the cost function J of theta

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:22.290
zero comma theta one and the height of

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:24.450
the surface above a particular point of

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:26.430
theta zero theta one right that's the

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:29.400
vertical axis the height of the surface

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:32.340
at the point indicates the value of J of

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:34.200
theta zero comma J of theta one and you

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:36.480
can see it sort of has this bow like

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:44.069
shape let me show you the same part in

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:46.560
3d so here's the same figure in 3d with

00:02:44.069 --> 00:02:48.510
axis a zero theta one and vertical axis

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:51.750
J of theta zero theta one and if I

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:53.910
rotate this your plot around you kind of

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:57.150
get a sense I hope this bell shaped

00:02:53.910 --> 00:03:00.329
surface is that's what the cost function

00:02:57.150 --> 00:03:02.280
J looks like now for the purpose of

00:03:00.329 --> 00:03:03.900
illustration in the rest of this video

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:06.450
I'm not actually going to use these

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:09.140
sorts of 3d surfaces to show you the

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:15.329
cost function J instead I'm going to use

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:16.319
contour plots or what I also call

00:03:15.329 --> 00:03:21.450
contour figures

00:03:16.319 --> 00:03:24.389
I guess they mean the same thing to show

00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:26.760
you these surfaces so here's an example

00:03:24.389 --> 00:03:30.720
of a contour figure shown on the right

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:34.680
where the axes are theta zero and theta

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:37.109
one and one of each of these ovals what

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:40.109
each of these ellipses shows is a set of

00:03:37.109 --> 00:03:44.940
points that takes on the same value for

00:03:40.109 --> 00:03:47.459
J of theta zero theta one so completely

00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:50.099
for example let's you know take that

00:03:47.459 --> 00:03:53.790
point at that point at that point all

00:03:50.099 --> 00:03:57.060
three of these points like just drew a

00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:59.099
magenta they have the same value for J

00:03:57.060 --> 00:04:00.540
of theta zero theta one okay where write

00:03:59.099 --> 00:04:03.120
these this is a theta zero theta one

00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:05.730
axis but those three have the same value

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:07.829
for J of theta zero comma theta one and

00:04:05.730 --> 00:04:10.200
if you haven't seen console parts much

00:04:07.829 --> 00:04:13.109
before think of imagine if you will a

00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:15.540
bowl shape function that's coming out at

00:04:13.109 --> 00:04:17.170
my screen so that the minimum so the

00:04:15.540 --> 00:04:18.790
bottom of the bowl is this

00:04:17.170 --> 00:04:21.760
right there right this middle the middle

00:04:18.790 --> 00:04:23.950
of these concentric ellipses and imagine

00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:26.170
a bow shape that's of grows out my

00:04:23.950 --> 00:04:28.060
screen like this so that each of these

00:04:26.170 --> 00:04:30.400
ellipses you know has the same height

00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:33.370
above my screen and the minimum of the

00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:36.190
bow right is right down there and so the

00:04:33.370 --> 00:04:38.140
contour figures is a way to is it maybe

00:04:36.190 --> 00:04:41.710
a more convenient way to visualize my

00:04:38.140 --> 00:04:46.690
function J so let's look at some

00:04:41.710 --> 00:04:50.710
examples over here I have a particular

00:04:46.690 --> 00:04:52.930
point right and so this is a with you

00:04:50.710 --> 00:04:58.150
know theta zero equals me about eight

00:04:52.930 --> 00:05:02.050
hundred and feita one equals maybe a

00:04:58.150 --> 00:05:04.060
minus 0.15 and so this point right is

00:05:02.050 --> 00:05:05.680
this point in red corresponds to one

00:05:04.060 --> 00:05:08.470
Pacific pair of values of theta zero

00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:11.200
comma theta one and they correspond in

00:05:08.470 --> 00:05:13.630
fact to that hypothesis right with theta

00:05:11.200 --> 00:05:16.060
zero is about 800 meters intersects the

00:05:13.630 --> 00:05:20.860
vertical axis around 800 and this is a

00:05:16.060 --> 00:05:22.990
slope of about minus 0.15 now this line

00:05:20.860 --> 00:05:25.390
is really not such a good fit to the

00:05:22.990 --> 00:05:27.790
data right this hypothesis H of X with

00:05:25.390 --> 00:05:30.100
these values of theta 0 theta 1 3 not

00:05:27.790 --> 00:05:33.730
such a good fit to the data and so you

00:05:30.100 --> 00:05:35.770
find that is cost as a value that's out

00:05:33.730 --> 00:05:38.020
here let's feel pretty far from the

00:05:35.770 --> 00:05:39.760
minimum right so it's pretty far it's in

00:05:38.020 --> 00:05:42.760
a pretty high cost because this is just

00:05:39.760 --> 00:05:44.950
not that good fit to the data let's look

00:05:42.760 --> 00:05:46.720
at some more examples now here's the

00:05:44.950 --> 00:05:48.520
different hypothesis that's you know

00:05:46.720 --> 00:05:50.950
still not a great fit of the data there

00:05:48.520 --> 00:05:53.200
may be slightly better so here right

00:05:50.950 --> 00:05:55.150
that's my point

00:05:53.200 --> 00:06:00.150
that those are my parameters theta zero

00:05:55.150 --> 00:06:06.160
theta one and so my theta zero value

00:06:00.150 --> 00:06:10.420
right that's um about 360 and my value

00:06:06.160 --> 00:06:11.860
for theta one is equal to 0 so you know

00:06:10.420 --> 00:06:17.320
let's write that out the state of 0

00:06:11.860 --> 00:06:20.230
equals 360 theta 1 equals 0 and this

00:06:17.320 --> 00:06:22.210
pair of parameters corresponds to that

00:06:20.230 --> 00:06:24.850
hypothesis corresponds to a flat line

00:06:22.210 --> 00:06:28.870
right this is H of x equals

00:06:24.850 --> 00:06:31.240
360 plus zero times X so that's my

00:06:28.870 --> 00:06:33.790
hypothesis and this hypothesis again has

00:06:31.240 --> 00:06:36.730
some cost and that causes you know

00:06:33.790 --> 00:06:39.790
plotted as the height of the J function

00:06:36.730 --> 00:06:42.820
at that point let's look at just a

00:06:39.790 --> 00:06:45.970
couple of examples here's one more you

00:06:42.820 --> 00:06:49.300
know at this value of theta zero and

00:06:45.970 --> 00:06:52.840
then that value of theta one we end up

00:06:49.300 --> 00:06:55.060
with this hypothesis H of X and again

00:06:52.840 --> 00:06:56.320
not a great fit to the data and just I

00:06:55.060 --> 00:06:59.140
can move even further out for the

00:06:56.320 --> 00:07:01.030
mineral last example this is actually

00:06:59.140 --> 00:07:02.950
not quite at the minimum but it's pretty

00:07:01.030 --> 00:07:05.380
close to minimum so this is not such a

00:07:02.950 --> 00:07:09.010
bad fit to the to the data where for a

00:07:05.380 --> 00:07:10.810
particular value of theta zero which

00:07:09.010 --> 00:07:13.390
whatever this value is in for a

00:07:10.810 --> 00:07:15.190
particular value of theta one we get a

00:07:13.390 --> 00:07:16.900
particular H of X and this is this is

00:07:15.190 --> 00:07:19.810
not quite at the minimum is pretty close

00:07:16.900 --> 00:07:22.510
and so the sum of squares errors or some

00:07:19.810 --> 00:07:25.270
squares distances between my training

00:07:22.510 --> 00:07:27.820
examples and my hypothesis every that's

00:07:25.270 --> 00:07:31.000
the sum of squared distances right of

00:07:27.820 --> 00:07:32.380
all of these errors this is pretty close

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:35.590
to the minimum even though it's not

00:07:32.380 --> 00:07:36.820
quite a minimum so with these figures I

00:07:35.590 --> 00:07:39.910
hope that gives you a better

00:07:36.820 --> 00:07:42.580
understanding of what values of the cost

00:07:39.910 --> 00:07:44.740
function J and how they are and how that

00:07:42.580 --> 00:07:46.750
corresponds to different hypotheses as

00:07:44.740 --> 00:07:49.240
well as how better hypotheses may

00:07:46.750 --> 00:07:52.360
correspond to points that closer to the

00:07:49.240 --> 00:07:54.280
minimum of this cost function J now of

00:07:52.360 --> 00:07:56.080
course what we really want is an

00:07:54.280 --> 00:07:58.030
efficient algorithm like your efficient

00:07:56.080 --> 00:08:00.160
piece of software for automatically

00:07:58.030 --> 00:08:01.660
finding the value of theta zero and

00:08:00.160 --> 00:08:04.750
theta one that minimizes the cost

00:08:01.660 --> 00:08:06.820
function J what we don't want to do is

00:08:04.750 --> 00:08:08.410
to you know have to write software to

00:08:06.820 --> 00:08:10.510
plot out this point and then try to

00:08:08.410 --> 00:08:13.090
manually read off we don't do that this

00:08:10.510 --> 00:08:15.700
is not a good way to do it and in fact

00:08:13.090 --> 00:08:17.860
we'll see later that when we look at

00:08:15.700 --> 00:08:19.360
more complicated examples will have

00:08:17.860 --> 00:08:21.130
higher dimensional figures with more

00:08:19.360 --> 00:08:23.620
parameters that that it turns out we'll

00:08:21.130 --> 00:08:26.350
see if you will see in maintenance cause

00:08:23.620 --> 00:08:28.180
examples where this figure you cannot

00:08:26.350 --> 00:08:32.110
really be plotted is becomes much harder

00:08:28.180 --> 00:08:34.810
to visualize and so what we want is to

00:08:32.110 --> 00:08:35.599
have software to find the value of theta

00:08:34.810 --> 00:08:38.569
0 thing

00:08:35.599 --> 00:08:40.519
then minimizes this function and in the

00:08:38.569 --> 00:08:42.800
next video we'll start to talk about an

00:08:40.519 --> 00:08:45.139
algorithm for automatically finding that

00:08:42.800 --> 00:08:48.579
value of theta zero and theta one that

00:08:45.139 --> 00:08:48.579
minimizes the cost function J
