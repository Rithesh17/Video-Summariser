SIMONE PETTIGREW: So autonomous vehicles feel new to most of us

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:07.720
as if we haven't heard much about them, but they've actually

00:00:07.720 --> 00:00:09.680
been in progress for quite some time.

00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:12.520
So the technological aspects of the development of the vehicles

00:00:12.520 --> 00:00:15.061
have been tinkering away in the background for decades.

00:00:15.061 --> 00:00:17.560
And if you think about the way that your vehicle works today

00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:20.050
compared to what your parents might have experienced,

00:00:20.050 --> 00:00:21.940
even the fact that they probably drive a manual and you

00:00:21.940 --> 00:00:23.290
drive an automatic vehicle now.

00:00:23.290 --> 00:00:27.880
So we've been seeing progressive improvements even down to your airbags

00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:30.310
pop up automatically now if you have an accident.

00:00:30.310 --> 00:00:31.690
But we have cruise control.

00:00:31.690 --> 00:00:34.990
We've got little devices in the car that center us in the lane

00:00:34.990 --> 00:00:37.150
if we want to use those kinds of devices.

00:00:37.150 --> 00:00:41.020
Some cars are capable of self-parking, others flash and indicate to us

00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:43.220
when we're getting too close to other objects.

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:46.390
So incrementally we've been increasing the amount of autonomous content

00:00:46.390 --> 00:00:47.780
within a vehicle.

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:50.890
It's just a matter of time until we take that extra leap and the vehicles

00:00:50.890 --> 00:00:55.030
become fully autonomous, which means that we won't need a steering wheel,

00:00:55.030 --> 00:00:56.860
we won't need brakes or accelerators.

00:00:56.860 --> 00:00:59.530
The vehicles will do all the driving for us.

00:00:59.530 --> 00:01:01.000
They will be GPS based.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:04.870
So we just tell them either verbally or program it in where we want to go

00:01:04.870 --> 00:01:08.020
and the vehicle will be capable of taking us there.

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:10.240
So that's kind of like the end goal.

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:13.210
And because the vehicle will be talking to lots of other vehicles

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:17.410
it can assess the extent to which there are blockages in traffic

00:01:17.410 --> 00:01:20.680
and pick different routes depending on the fastest possible available route

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:22.900
available at that point in time, depending

00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:27.110
on how other many road users there are all trying to get to the same place.

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:29.680
So it really will be interesting times once

00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:34.630
we move to the other end, the full end of the autonomous spectrum.

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:38.350
At the moment we have the capability for vehicles to be autonomous,

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:40.347
but there are kind of constraining factors

00:01:40.347 --> 00:01:42.430
that are preventing that from happening right now.

00:01:42.430 --> 00:01:46.300
And one of the major ones is the fact that we've got hundreds of road rules

00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:48.280
all of which specify the driver.

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:51.790
So until those road rules can be changed we're still going to be in a situation

00:01:51.790 --> 00:01:53.740
where we're not allowed to drive autonomous

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:56.150
vehicles in full autonomous mode.

00:01:56.150 --> 00:01:58.650
However, within the next three or four years

00:01:58.650 --> 00:02:00.400
we're looking at sort of certain precincts

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:03.640
probably being able to do that on Curtin campus, for instance,

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:05.500
we have our autonomous bus.

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:08.229
And that's allowed to be in autonomous mode because of the fact

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:10.880
that it's largely on private property.

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:14.950
So we'll kind of see individual areas, geographical areas introducing

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:16.330
autonomous vehicles first.

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:17.110
PAUL NICHOLLS: Hi.

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:17.800
I'm Paul Nicholls.

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:20.424
I'm the Director of Strategic Projects Research and Development

00:02:20.424 --> 00:02:22.840
here at Curtin University, Perth, Western Australia.

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:26.560
This is Kip, our AV bus that we've had operating for about three months now

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:28.510
on the Curtin University campus.

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:31.610
The bus is called Kip after the Curtin University namesake.

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:32.950
So John Curtin.

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:34.930
Kip was the name of one of his dogs.

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:37.180
Curtin's purchased an AV bus because we think

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:41.440
it's a great way for us to trial these sorts of disruptive technologies.

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:44.279
The same as mobile phones have disrupted the way we operate.

00:02:44.279 --> 00:02:46.570
And the internet has created all of these opportunities

00:02:46.570 --> 00:02:47.770
to do things differently.

00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:51.229
An AV bus can really disrupt the way that we operate in a community.

00:02:51.229 --> 00:02:53.020
SIMONE PETTIGREW: In terms of when we might

00:02:53.020 --> 00:02:57.070
look at having loads of different autonomous vehicles on the roads,

00:02:57.070 --> 00:03:00.700
they say by about 2040 we may have around 3/4

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:03.220
of vehicles in fully autonomous mode.

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:06.550
So I think we can see quite rapid adoption of autonomous vehicles

00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:08.180
coming up in the future.

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:11.320
But this is also an evidence based proposition

00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:14.020
if you like because if you think back to the early 1900s

00:03:14.020 --> 00:03:16.510
when the motorcar was first introduced, we've

00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:20.200
got the situation where in New York City, for instance, in the year 1900

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:25.810
you had the Main Street with one car and all the rest being horse and carts.

00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:28.510
13 years later, we've got the situation where

00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:31.790
there's one horse and cart surrounded by motor vehicles.

00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:34.320
So even back then in the space of 13 years

00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:38.990
there was complete saturation of a new disruptive transport technology.

00:03:38.990 --> 00:03:42.332
So if we extrapolate that out now to the 2000s,

00:03:42.332 --> 00:03:44.290
and we're even more receptive to new technology

00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:47.040
it's going to be more affordable relatively than it was back then.

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:49.630
I think we're looking at really fast adoption rates.

00:03:49.630 --> 00:03:52.570
The future with autonomous vehicles will look

00:03:52.570 --> 00:03:54.260
very different to the way it does now.

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:57.850
So in the interim period we'll probably still have things like traffic lights,

00:03:57.850 --> 00:03:59.590
but the flows should be much better.

00:03:59.590 --> 00:04:01.810
Ultimately, however, we're looking at a situation

00:04:01.810 --> 00:04:05.860
where there are no traffic lights and those vehicles down to the millimeter

00:04:05.860 --> 00:04:06.700
can be pinpointed.

00:04:06.700 --> 00:04:09.400
They'll be each talking to more than 30 satellites,

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:11.540
as well as communicating with each other.

00:04:11.540 --> 00:04:17.320
So they are perfectly well programmed to be able to mix in with each other

00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:18.880
again down to the millimeter.

00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:20.980
So you're looking at a situation of intersections

00:04:20.980 --> 00:04:23.110
without traffic lights and traffic just merging.

00:04:23.110 --> 00:04:25.450
So you'd have traffic coming from different directions

00:04:25.450 --> 00:04:27.190
just blending it and keeping on going.

00:04:27.190 --> 00:04:30.110
And I know that's a difficult concept to get your head around,

00:04:30.110 --> 00:04:34.430
but longer term the computers are very well set up to be able to do that.

00:04:34.430 --> 00:04:38.180
So for instance, traffic control at the moment for airplanes already does that.

00:04:38.180 --> 00:04:42.190
We have the airplanes in the sky on automatic pilot for much of the flight

00:04:42.190 --> 00:04:44.590
and we have computers determining when and where they're

00:04:44.590 --> 00:04:48.050
going to pass other flights and when and where they are going to land.

00:04:48.050 --> 00:04:51.100
So we do put our faith in these machines in some areas.

00:04:51.100 --> 00:04:54.190
It's just going to be a matter of transferring that to motor vehicles

00:04:54.190 --> 00:04:56.470
and getting used to that new system.

00:04:56.470 --> 00:04:58.810
The logistics around that, of course, are

00:04:58.810 --> 00:05:00.940
interesting because we're looking at a situation

00:05:00.940 --> 00:05:04.010
where all the frequencies have to be the same.

00:05:04.010 --> 00:05:07.160
So all the vehicles have to be talking to each other on the same frequency.

00:05:07.160 --> 00:05:10.640
If only one vehicle has its GPS out by a few millimeters

00:05:10.640 --> 00:05:11.992
it could create absolute havoc.

00:05:11.992 --> 00:05:14.950
So we really need to have the system set up well enough so that they're

00:05:14.950 --> 00:05:17.540
talking to each other with perfect compatibility,

00:05:17.540 --> 00:05:20.870
that all of those vehicles are registering their location in exactly

00:05:20.870 --> 00:05:24.430
the same way, and are able to communicate that to each other

00:05:24.430 --> 00:05:25.510
immediately.

00:05:25.510 --> 00:05:28.040
We'll have lots of spinoff benefits from that as well.

00:05:28.040 --> 00:05:31.269
So the vehicles, as well as having their own senses

00:05:31.269 --> 00:05:33.560
that can tell them what's in the immediate environment.

00:05:33.560 --> 00:05:36.650
They can tap into what other vehicles are sensing.

00:05:36.650 --> 00:05:39.620
So if there are potholes, if there are road signs missing,

00:05:39.620 --> 00:05:42.530
if there are road works, the vehicles can immediately

00:05:42.530 --> 00:05:46.100
communicate that to the network rather than each individual vehicle

00:05:46.100 --> 00:05:49.550
having to learn each time it passes by that particular scene.

00:05:49.550 --> 00:05:52.220
We can have huge savings in terms of trip times.

00:05:52.220 --> 00:05:55.520
So we're very much looking at a blended system in order for it

00:05:55.520 --> 00:05:57.470
to be as efficient as possible.

00:05:57.470 --> 00:06:01.564
It would be quite inefficient if every individual wanted

00:06:01.564 --> 00:06:04.730
to own their own autonomous vehicle, we would just end up with a whole bunch

00:06:04.730 --> 00:06:06.410
more vehicles on the road.

00:06:06.410 --> 00:06:08.480
So for instance, your vehicle would drive you

00:06:08.480 --> 00:06:10.394
into the city in the morning to go to work.

00:06:10.394 --> 00:06:13.060
It would turn around and drive itself home again, or take itself

00:06:13.060 --> 00:06:14.720
somewhere else to recharge.

00:06:14.720 --> 00:06:17.600
It would then come and collect you in the evening and take you home.

00:06:17.600 --> 00:06:21.000
So rather than that vehicle just being on the road while you're in it,

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:24.220
it's now also on the road for quite a while you're not in it.

00:06:24.220 --> 00:06:27.320
So multiply that out by the number of people in the population

00:06:27.320 --> 00:06:31.430
and there's the potential for increases in congestion instead of decreases.

00:06:31.430 --> 00:06:35.480
So we're very keen for public policy makers our governments to be proactive

00:06:35.480 --> 00:06:37.850
in this space to make sure that we encourage

00:06:37.850 --> 00:06:40.430
the rollout of autonomous vehicles in such a way

00:06:40.430 --> 00:06:42.370
that we do prioritize public transport.

00:06:42.370 --> 00:06:45.530
So we've got really good efficient public transport that

00:06:45.530 --> 00:06:49.081
runs autonomously, as well as those backup last mile, first mile

00:06:49.081 --> 00:06:50.830
services that can help people so that they

00:06:50.830 --> 00:06:53.163
don't have to actually own a vehicle, but they can still

00:06:53.163 --> 00:06:55.460
get really good transport to and from.

00:06:55.460 --> 00:06:59.300
And then to have their own individual autonomous vehicle as the backup,

00:06:59.300 --> 00:07:01.212
as the last thing that you would consider.

00:07:01.212 --> 00:07:03.170
PAUL NICHOLLS: In the future, Curtin University

00:07:03.170 --> 00:07:06.440
hopes to have a range of autonomous vehicles operating across the campus.

00:07:06.440 --> 00:07:10.140
It'll help improve the experience of our students and the guests to the campus,

00:07:10.140 --> 00:07:12.270
but also improve their safety.

00:07:12.270 --> 00:07:15.650
Over time we expect that the level of autonomy of these vehicles

00:07:15.650 --> 00:07:18.740
will actually improve to the point where we can take our technicians out

00:07:18.740 --> 00:07:23.180
of the system and where we can go fully autonomous on the campus.

00:07:23.180 --> 00:07:25.430
The vehicles we hope will be able to identify

00:07:25.430 --> 00:07:28.460
where students are on the campus that need to be moved and actually

00:07:28.460 --> 00:07:32.350
optimize the movement of those students across the campus.
