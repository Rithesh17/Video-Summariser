IAIN MURRAY: Welcome.

00:00:03.760 --> 00:00:05.843
I'm Iain Murray, and I'm a Professor of Electrical

00:00:05.843 --> 00:00:07.830
and Computer Engineering at Curtin University.

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:10.913
And I'll be taking you through the Introduction to The Internet of Things.

00:00:10.913 --> 00:00:13.820
So what we'll be looking at in this course that you've just started

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:16.790
is we'll have an overview of The Internet of Things--

00:00:16.790 --> 00:00:19.490
the businesses that can help, some examples and case

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:22.890
studies of The Internet of Things in the real world.

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:25.310
We'll then move on and look at, what are the things?

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:26.460
It's an internet of things.

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:27.517
What are those things?

00:00:27.517 --> 00:00:30.350
And then we'll have a look at how we connect these things together--

00:00:30.350 --> 00:00:33.492
the network that underlies The Internet of Things.

00:00:33.492 --> 00:00:36.200
Following on from that, we'll look at how we program specifically

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:38.810
for The Internet of Things, and the kind of languages

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:42.487
and how we handle the big data that's involved and how we store it.

00:00:42.487 --> 00:00:44.570
We'll then move on to that very important aspect--

00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:47.360
the security and privacy issues of The Internet of Things.

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:49.630
And finally, we'll look at the design process.

00:00:49.630 --> 00:00:52.130
Right so, generally, that's The Internet of Things.

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:55.220
Let's now have a look at some applications and case studies

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:58.480
of The Internet of Things in the real world.
