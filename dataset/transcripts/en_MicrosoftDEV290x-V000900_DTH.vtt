00:00:01.010 --> 00:00:04.500
>> The kinds of model we can build with scikit-learn are

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:07.875
rooted in statistics and regression-based mathematics.

00:00:07.875 --> 00:00:10.800
This so-called classical machine learning techniques are

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:13.505
very powerful and relatively easy to implement.

00:00:13.505 --> 00:00:15.030
So it's no surprise that they're used in

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:17.580
many cutting edge AI solutions.

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:20.820
However, when it comes to computer vision,

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:24.015
there are some limitations that you should be aware of.

00:00:24.015 --> 00:00:28.200
First, the algorithms used to separate the image pixel arrays into

00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:31.680
classes are very susceptible to variations in color,

00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:34.515
contrast, lighting conditions, and so on.

00:00:34.515 --> 00:00:36.495
Then, you can mitigate this by

00:00:36.495 --> 00:00:38.980
equalizing and otherwise preparing the images,

00:00:38.980 --> 00:00:41.620
but that can require a lot of work.

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:45.830
A more difficult problem is that classical machine learning

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:49.855
techniques apply to the entire array of pixel values.

00:00:49.855 --> 00:00:52.670
Now, only some of these pixels actually

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:55.655
describe features of the object you're trying to classify.

00:00:55.655 --> 00:00:58.640
The classical algorithms can be heavily influenced by

00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:00.170
background pixels that have

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:03.640
little or no bearing on the class of object.
