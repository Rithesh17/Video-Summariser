IAIN MURRAY: Welcome back.

00:00:03.740 --> 00:00:04.580
I'm Iain Murray.

00:00:04.580 --> 00:00:09.040
And we're now looking at the sensors and devices section of the course,

00:00:09.040 --> 00:00:11.350
or things as we would rather call them.

00:00:11.350 --> 00:00:14.570
So you may be wondering where we're talking about The Internet of Things.

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:15.730
What is a thing?

00:00:15.730 --> 00:00:18.430
Well, this is a thing.

00:00:18.430 --> 00:00:19.750
This is a sensor.

00:00:19.750 --> 00:00:22.360
It's a sensor that reads something about the environment.

00:00:22.360 --> 00:00:23.360
We can read many things.

00:00:23.360 --> 00:00:27.700
We can read gas level, CO2, humidity, temperature.

00:00:27.700 --> 00:00:30.940
Lots of different items.

00:00:30.940 --> 00:00:32.540
This is also a thing.

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:33.280
It's a speaker.

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:35.000
It's something that has an output.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:38.110
So if you look at them together we have a sensor, which is an input,

00:00:38.110 --> 00:00:40.100
and an actuator, which is an output.

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:42.100
In this case, a speaker, or it could be a motor,

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:46.040
or it could be a relay or something else that performs an action.

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:48.730
They need to be connected to a computer.

00:00:48.730 --> 00:00:51.560
And generally we use very small computers like this one.

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:53.370
This is a microcontroller.

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:56.620
And this is a device that reads the input from the sensor

00:00:56.620 --> 00:00:59.420
and can output some action to the actuator.

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:05.610
So if we look at our microcontroller, our input sensor, and our actuator,

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:08.320
and we put these together that is a thing.

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:10.900
And this is the thing that we connect to the internet.

00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:13.810
Of particular interest this is a really small thing,

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:16.056
but you can also have very large things.

00:01:16.056 --> 00:01:18.430
If you look at the case study later on of the engineering

00:01:18.430 --> 00:01:22.030
pavilion at Curtin University that is a thing on the internet.

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:25.622
So an Internet of Things, thing, but that is not small.

00:01:25.622 --> 00:01:26.830
It's a three storey building.

00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:30.850
So we tend to talk about devices and things.

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:33.520
These terms can be used somewhat interchangeably.

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:37.360
A thing, as we've mentioned, is a sensor or an actuator

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:41.860
connected to a small computer that reads something about the environment

00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:44.830
or acts on an element within that environment.

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:47.500
A device, we tend to, and this is not always true,

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:51.650
but we tend to talk about this sort of thing as a device.

00:01:51.650 --> 00:01:55.630
It's something that has other uses, is intelligent, but it contains sensors,

00:01:55.630 --> 00:01:57.970
it contains the communication methods that we

00:01:57.970 --> 00:02:00.980
need for the Internet of Things, but it serves other purposes.

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:02.380
So it becomes a device.

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:04.570
So we've had a chat about the device and things

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:07.340
that we'll be examining in this course.

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:10.630
So let's go in and we'll explore a few of the different types of sensors

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:13.020
that are available to us.
