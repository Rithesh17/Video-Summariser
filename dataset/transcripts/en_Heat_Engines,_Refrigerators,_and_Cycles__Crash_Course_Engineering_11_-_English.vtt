00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:06.360
To succeed in engineering, you have to master
the art of repetition.

00:00:06.360 --> 00:00:12.960
That applies to repetition in your own work
– so that you’re always designing, prototyping,
testing, and then designing again.

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:16.860
But repetition is also key to the processes
that you use as an engineer.

00:00:16.860 --> 00:00:18.800
I’m talking here about cycles.

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:26.660
They can be pretty complex, but at their core,
each one is just a sequence of events or steps
that repeat themselves in the same order.

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:31.760
And that’s exactly what’s happening in some
of the most commonly used devices that have
ever been engineered,

00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:36.760
like the heat pump that’s heating your home
and the refrigerator that’s keeping your food
from spoiling.

00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:38.760
So, let’s learn, and then repeat.

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:48.900
[Theme Music]

00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:55.740
In engineering, we say that a system has
undergone a cycle if it returns to its initial
state at the end of the process.

00:00:55.740 --> 00:00:58.540
So, its initial and final states should be
the same.

00:00:58.540 --> 00:01:05.690
And cycles are important because, they allow us
to run through the same process again and again,
instead of limiting us to doing something only once.

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:11.900
With the right resources, we can keep running
through cycles until we get enough of what we
want, like the distance traveled in a car.

00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:17.680
We can also keep making cycles for as long
as we need, say, to keep food cold in a fridge
at a constant temperature.

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:24.930
The process that your fridge uses today is
based on the work of 19th century American
inventors Oliver Evans and Jacob Perkins.

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:32.170
In 1805, Evans came up with a closed
vapor-compression refrigeration cycle, but
he never actually built a refrigerator.

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:36.920
Then, in the 1830’s, Perkins used Evans’
ideas and actually did.

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:43.380
Perkins’ system didn’t succeed commercially
at first, but it was the first step towards the
modern refrigerators that we use today.

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:45.400
So how do refrigeration cycles work?

00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:50.960
Well, it’s easier to understand if we start
with something similar that we already know
a bit about: heat engines.

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:56.540
Last time, we learned that heat engines are
machines or systems that convert heat into
other forms of energy.

00:01:56.540 --> 00:02:02.940
A basic heat engine can do this by taking
in heat at a higher temperature, from say,
solar energy or a furnace,

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:07.920
and then converting part of that heat to work,
usually by rotating a shaft.

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:15.660
The engine then releases wasted heat at a lower
temperature, maybe into its surroundings or a water
supply, and then readies itself to start over again.

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:19.160
So, like so many other things, heat engines
operate on a cycle.

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:26.780
And cycles achieve some goal, like heating or
cooling a room, by circulating what’s known as
a working fluid through a series of operations.

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:32.020
This working fluid will absorb and release energy,
change from liquid to vapor and back again,

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:35.680
and continue to circulate through the
cycle as part of the system’s operation.

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:39.230
So, let’s look at a heat engine that uses
water as its working fluid.

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:41.520
It goes through four main stages.

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:46.860
In the first stage, we’ll add heat to our
system by bringing in an energy source, QH.

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:51.360
The water will absorb this heat through a boiler,
which will cause it to become compressed steam.

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:56.600
In stage two, that steam will enter a turbine,
expand, and cause the turbine shaft to turn,

00:02:56.600 --> 00:03:02.440
which gives us an output of work, Wout,
which was converted from some of the heat
energy in our fluid.

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:05.380
Remember, not all of the heat energy will
convert to work.

00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:08.860
We’re going to have excess heat, which needs
to be released from our system.

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:16.580
We do this in stage 3 by condensing the
steam in a condenser, which releases that
excess heat into an energy sink, QL.

00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:20.640
For the fourth and final stage, our fluid
needs to be re-pressurized.

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:24.460
To make this happen, we’ll send it through
a pump, which will need work as an input.

00:03:24.460 --> 00:03:29.980
We’ll then send the re-pressurized water
back to the boiler at the beginning to start
the process all over again!

00:03:29.990 --> 00:03:31.320
That’s just one cycle.

00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:34.310
For each one that we do, we should have an
output of work.

00:03:34.310 --> 00:03:42.780
And if we look at the heat engine as a closed system,
then the total changes in the kinetic energy, potential
energy, and internal energy are all 0 through the cycle.

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:47.820
So, per the first law of thermodynamics, the changes
in work and heat should equal themselves out!

00:03:47.820 --> 00:03:51.260
Now, another way of looking at this cycle
is by using a phase diagram.

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:56.340
Phase diagrams compare different properties
to show what state or phase a substance is in.

00:03:56.340 --> 00:04:04.980
For this example, we’ll compare entropy to the
temperature of the heat engine’s fluid using the Rankine
cycle, which is the ideal cycle for vapor power plants.

00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:13.640
If we take a look at the diagram, all the material to
the left of the curve is in a liquid phase, while all the
material to the right is in a gaseous state.

00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:17.000
Everything under the curve is a mixture of
gas and liquid.

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:23.260
This plot lets us easily see what phase our
fluid is in as it goes through each stage of
the heat engine cycle.

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:30.900
Now, not only is the heat engine a great way to turn
heat energy into work, but with a few small changes,
we can turn it into a very different type of system.

00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:34.860
Instead of trying to get work as our output,
what if we tried to get heat?

00:04:34.860 --> 00:04:38.050
Well, we do this every day when we try to
heat or cool our homes!

00:04:38.050 --> 00:04:45.180
We use heat pumps to add heat to a system when
we’re feeling chilly, and refrigerators to remove heat
from a system when we want to keep things cool.

00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:49.760
In either case, we put work into the system,
rather than trying to get it out.

00:04:49.760 --> 00:04:54.340
What’s interesting for refrigerators and
heat pumps is that, since we’re aiming for
an output of heat,

00:04:54.340 --> 00:05:00.220
it’s possible to get a 100% conversion
from work, which we know from the second
law of thermodynamics.

00:05:00.220 --> 00:05:04.840
However, it’s important to note that even though
all of our work can be converted into heat,

00:05:04.840 --> 00:05:09.700
it may not all be the exact heat we want,
because we're still going to have two different
temperature levels.

00:05:09.700 --> 00:05:12.780
Now, with all that in mind, let’s go back
to the refrigerator.

00:05:12.780 --> 00:05:19.540
If we’re talking about the fridge in your
kitchen, the inside stays cool because of what’s
happening on its rear exterior wall.

00:05:19.540 --> 00:05:21.360
This is where our cycle will take place.

00:05:21.360 --> 00:05:29.220
Just like with the heat engine, we can break this
cycle down into four stages, again with a working
fluid that’s circulating through all the stages.

00:05:29.220 --> 00:05:36.120
In your kitchen fridge, this working fluid
is a hydrochlorofluorocarbon chemical that’s
usually referred to generically as freon.

00:05:36.120 --> 00:05:41.420
The first stage of the cycle is the evaporator,
which removes heat from the inside of the fridge.

00:05:41.420 --> 00:05:48.740
It starts out with liquid fluid that’s colder
than the inside of the fridge, which is the result
of the last stage of the previous cycle.

00:05:48.749 --> 00:05:49.860
But we’ll get to that.

00:05:49.860 --> 00:05:53.980
So, this liquid is really cold, but its boiling
point is also really low.

00:05:53.980 --> 00:05:57.500
In fact, the liquid is just about at the temperature
where it’s ready to boil.

00:05:57.509 --> 00:06:00.870
And when a liquid changes to a gas, it absorbs
heat.

00:06:00.870 --> 00:06:05.520
So when the liquid in the evaporator boils,
it absorbs heat from the refrigerator at the
same time.

00:06:05.520 --> 00:06:09.460
But even though it’s absorbing heat, its
temperature doesn’t actually change.

00:06:09.460 --> 00:06:14.260
All that heat energy is going into changing
the liquid into a gas, not raising its temperature.

00:06:14.260 --> 00:06:16.039
Stage two is the compressor.

00:06:16.040 --> 00:06:21.160
Its job is to raise the pressure of the gas,
which also raises its temperature — and
its boiling point.

00:06:21.160 --> 00:06:26.000
After stage two is complete, the gas is really
hot — hotter than the air outside the fridge.

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:31.740
But because its boiling point increased too,
it’s still around the temperature where it’s ready
to condense into a liquid.

00:06:31.740 --> 00:06:37.880
Which brings us to stage three: the condenser,
which is basically the opposite of the evaporator
in stage one.

00:06:37.880 --> 00:06:42.480
In the condenser, the gas turns into a liquid,
a process that releases heat.

00:06:42.480 --> 00:06:48.620
Since the refrigerant is now hotter than
the air outside, heat can flow from inside the
condenser to the surrounding air.

00:06:48.620 --> 00:06:53.279
But, like in the evaporator, the temperature
of the refrigerant stays constant in the condenser.

00:06:53.280 --> 00:07:00.210
Finally, in stage four, an expansion valve throttles
the liquid, lowering its pressure — and therefore,
lowering both its temperature and boiling point.

00:07:00.210 --> 00:07:02.780
It’s the opposite of what happens in the
compressor.

00:07:02.780 --> 00:07:09.620
You end up with cold liquid refrigerant at
a lower pressure, ready to enter the evaporator
and start the process all over again,

00:07:09.620 --> 00:07:12.300
absorbing more heat from the fridge as it boils.

00:07:12.300 --> 00:07:17.420
So basically, the food inside your fridge
stays cold because we’re taking heat out
from the inside of your fridge.

00:07:17.420 --> 00:07:24.000
And we can see this all a bit more clearly
if we take another look at a phase diagram,
this time for a refrigeration cycle.

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:31.120
While similar to the phase diagram for the heat
engine, we’ll see a few differences in what phases
our fluid is in at the different stages.

00:07:31.120 --> 00:07:36.500
The fluid spends more time in a gaseous
state and less time as a liquid than our fluid
did for the heat engine.

00:07:36.500 --> 00:07:43.300
Now, full cycles like these are great, but sometimes
we’ll need to have an incomplete cycle with a little
outside help to get what we want.

00:07:43.300 --> 00:07:47.480
That’s because sometimes we’re limited by
our environments and what we have available.

00:07:47.480 --> 00:07:52.900
So, for example, refrigerators often need
electricity, but that kind of power isn’t
always available.

00:07:52.900 --> 00:07:56.620
So, with a little bit of problem-solving,
we can design ones that don’t need it!

00:07:56.620 --> 00:07:58.659
That was the idea behind the zeer pot.

00:07:58.660 --> 00:08:05.960
The zeer pot is a simple refrigerator made
from one earthen pot set inside another, with
a layer of wet sand in between them.

00:08:05.960 --> 00:08:15.060
It was made famous by Nigerian inventor Mohammed
Bah Abba in the 1990’s, but similar devices may
date back all the way to Egypt around 2500 BCE.

00:08:15.060 --> 00:08:16.860
So how does the zeer pot work?

00:08:16.860 --> 00:08:22.100
Well, as the moisture from the sand evaporates,
it cools the inner pot by “pulling” out heat.

00:08:22.100 --> 00:08:26.960
It’s a great way to have a refrigeration
system in a hot climate when you have very
limited resources.

00:08:26.960 --> 00:08:30.520
But while it’s pretty awesome, the zeer
pot isn’t quite a cycle.

00:08:30.520 --> 00:08:37.940
Without recapturing the evaporated water, we’re going
to need some outside work to make our sand wet again
if we want to continue the cooling process.

00:08:37.940 --> 00:08:41.600
So, sometimes we need to forgo a perfect cycle
for the sake of practically.

00:08:41.600 --> 00:08:47.060
But all that being said, let’s say we do
have the resources for a refrigerator that
can run on a cycle.

00:08:47.060 --> 00:08:49.620
How can we improve this process even more?

00:08:49.620 --> 00:08:55.020
Well, one way is by using a renewable energy
resource to fuel our system and produce the
work that we need!

00:08:55.020 --> 00:08:57.100
Solar energy is a great example.

00:08:57.100 --> 00:09:00.500
Rather than taking electricity that was
made from a typical source,

00:09:00.500 --> 00:09:09.040
we can use solar-powered photovoltaic panels
to convert the sun’s rays into electricity by exciting
the electrons within the panel’s cells.

00:09:09.040 --> 00:09:15.980
The electricity that we’d get from this energy
could replace the work that we needed for the cycle,
thus making the cycle itself more reusable!

00:09:15.980 --> 00:09:22.780
Which is great, because a big goal for us as
engineers is to find ways to improve our processes,
even when something is already working.

00:09:22.780 --> 00:09:25.880
We can always improve on our designs in one
way or another.

00:09:25.890 --> 00:09:27.990
We can always take another step forward.

00:09:27.990 --> 00:09:33.240
The refrigerators that we make now are far
better than the ones that Perkins made back
in the 1800’s.

00:09:33.240 --> 00:09:36.320
Our heat engines are getting more and more
efficient as time goes on.

00:09:36.320 --> 00:09:40.640
You see, the journey of an engineer is both
discovery and optimization.

00:09:40.640 --> 00:09:42.220
And we’re just getting started.

00:09:42.220 --> 00:09:47.020
So today, we learned all about cycles, what
they are, and some of the systems that use them.

00:09:47.020 --> 00:09:49.300
One of the biggest ones was heat engines.

00:09:49.310 --> 00:09:53.720
Not only did we learn how heat engines work,
but we also saw that with a few small changes,

00:09:53.720 --> 00:09:57.920
we can create other systems too, like refrigerators
and heat pumps.

00:09:57.920 --> 00:10:02.440
We also learned about phase diagrams and the
power of using renewable energy resources.

00:10:02.440 --> 00:10:06.700
I’ll see you next time, when we’ll learn
about fluid mechanics and momentum transfer.

00:10:06.710 --> 00:10:10.790
