00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:07.390
SPEAKER: For this internet of things scenario,

00:00:07.390 --> 00:00:13.266
we will take a lawn sprinkler.

00:00:13.266 --> 00:00:15.555
We'll look at a water level monitor.

00:00:19.570 --> 00:00:26.670
And we have a humidity monitor or a humiture monitor,

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:30.520
which is humidity and temperature combined.

00:00:30.520 --> 00:00:35.470
And if we go across into the Smart City subcategory,

00:00:35.470 --> 00:00:40.190
there is also an atmospheric pressure monitor.

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:45.390
Now, one more thing to add is an industrial category;

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:49.880
across here, a water drain.

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:53.500
The situation we are simulating here could

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:58.150
be used within industry, such as market gardens.

00:00:58.150 --> 00:01:03.140
Or it could be public assets, public lawns.

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:06.380
And in all these situations, water could be

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:09.800
wasted if sprinklers are on when they don't need to be.

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:12.400
So here is a water monitor, just say this is just

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:15.320
for sensing moisture at this point.

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:22.050
That's connected, so that the sprinkler only activates when the soil is dry.

00:01:22.050 --> 00:01:28.620
But if it can also monitor atmospheric pressure changes and humidity

00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:31.290
and temperature, it can look at all the weather conditions

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:35.070
to determine whether it is necessary to activate a sprinkler.

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:39.370
And if I hold down Alt here and click on the lawn sprinkler,

00:01:39.370 --> 00:01:46.050
you can see the monitor is simulating that it's a 100% moisture.

00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:49.170
And the sprinkler should be turned off at this point.

00:01:53.620 --> 00:01:58.020
But let's say that the water level monitor is also testing

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:01.500
for excessive water, such as flooding.

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:10.770
And rather than just not turning the sprinkler on, it will open a drain.

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:16.260
So let's just simulate a lot of rainfall by turning the sprinkler back on.

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:19.020
You can see it might sense that it's being flooded.

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:25.820
And the water drain connected via the internet can be opened.

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:29.030
And the water disappears.

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:35.560
This scenario shows that by connecting sensors and actuators together

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:39.830
via a network, which may be a wireless network in the local area

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:45.350
or it may be via the mobile phone 3G, 4G networks, or whatever,

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:48.740
if they're connected and able to communicate and change

00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:51.930
their actions based on what they're receiving from each other.

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:57.520
This is an application and a use for an Internet of Things system.
