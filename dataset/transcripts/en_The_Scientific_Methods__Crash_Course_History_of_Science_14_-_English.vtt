00:00:05.299 --> 00:00:09.190
I started this course by saying that people
have made knowledge about the natural world,

00:00:09.190 --> 00:00:10.210
pretty much forever.

00:00:10.210 --> 00:00:15.010
They’ve done this by carefully observing
the world and then devising tests to find

00:00:15.010 --> 00:00:16.609
out if their ideas are true.

00:00:16.609 --> 00:00:22.230
Today, we refer to a specific series of steps—coming
up with a hypothesis, testing it, and drawing

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:25.659
conclusions—as the scientific method.

00:00:25.659 --> 00:00:29.300
But, historically speaking, there is no one
scientific method.

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:31.199
There’s more than one way to make knowledge.

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:35.720
Still, if you look at some of the great minds
who helped shape today’s concept of the

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:39.510
scientific method, a set of basic principles
starts to emerge.

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:40.780
Like rationality.

00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:42.050
Experimentation.

00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:44.440
And ruthless self-examination.

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:49.070
For these ideas and a lot of other stuff, we have to
thank three of the natural philosophers who

00:00:49.070 --> 00:00:54.800
pioneered this abstract “scientific method”:
Galileo, Bacon, and Descartes.

00:00:54.800 --> 00:01:03.180
[INTRO MUSIC PLAYS}

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:05.280
Galileo, Bacon, and Descartes are each so

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:08.140
fascinating that they could each have their
own episode.

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:12.150
But one reason to talk about them together
is that they lived at roughly the same time.

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:17.141
A lot changed in European natural philosophy
between the mid-1500s and the mid-1600s, when

00:01:17.141 --> 00:01:19.260
Newton started dropping his hits.

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:20.440
We’ll get there later!

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:24.840
But first, Dr. Galileo Galilei was born in
Pisa in 1564.

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:29.720
He considered becoming a priest, studied art,
attended school for medicine, but then attended

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:35.470
a lecture on geometry, and went on to study
math in secret, because his dad wanted him

00:01:35.470 --> 00:01:36.470
to focus on medicine.

00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:41.210
Much to his father’s chagrin, I’m sure,
Galileo became a professor of a bunch of math-related

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:45.890
stuff at University of Pisa, a lowly, poorly
paid position.

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:51.840
In 1593, Galileo took a job as a ballistics
consultant at the Arsenal of Venice, which

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:54.000
is a heck of a title to have on your C.V.

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:59.330
Then, starting in 1609, he built and refined
telescopes, which eventually made him famous.

00:01:59.330 --> 00:02:05.090
The very first telescope was invented by Dutch
spectacle-maker Hans Lippershey in Holland

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:06.090
in 1608.

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:07.940
But Galileo’s versions were much better.

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:13.520
And telescopes are a good example of how scientific
instruments change the nature of scientific

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:14.520
practice.

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:19.030
We often design experiments around how we
can use our instruments—in the case of astronomy,

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:21.450
around what we can see through a telescope.

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:26.840
With his new telescopic success, Galileo quit
his job at Pisa for a much better one at Padua,

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:31.560
and he also took on the role of Chief Mathematician
and Philosopher of Florence.

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:33.660
I love this guy's resume!!!

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:38.120
As he continued to research the night sky,
Galileo became convinced that Copernicus was

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:41.190
right: the earth is not the center of the
universe.

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:44.780
He also looked into Kepler’s ideas but wasn’t
convinced by them.

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:48.210
By 1611, Galileo’s name had been brought
up by the Inquisition.

00:02:48.210 --> 00:02:52.210
And, of course, nobody expects that.

00:02:52.210 --> 00:02:57.480
But it seems that his vocal support of Copernicanism
was creating some friction in the Florentine

00:02:57.480 --> 00:02:58.480
court.

00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:01.980
Among many others, the Grand Duchess Christina,
who was basically one of his patrons, said

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:04.670
she took issue with the idea of heliocentrism.

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:10.310
So in 1615, he wrote to a letter to explaining
that the Bible and nature did not disagree:

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:15.540
One was God’s word to the masses—a story
about how to behave and why.

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:19.670
The other was God’s work—the physical
reality that He created.

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:23.670
So science, he said, was simply the uncovering
of God’s work.

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:25.120
Galileo was a man of faith!

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:30.160
Unfortunately for him, Church officials didn’t
like this explanation.

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:34.570
In 1616, the Church added Copernicus’ text,
De rev, to its official list of banned books.

00:03:34.570 --> 00:03:39.310
The Inquisitors deemed heliocentrism “foolish
and absurd in philosophy.”

00:03:39.310 --> 00:03:43.890
This was bad news for Galileo: he was told
not to uphold or defend Copernicanism.

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:49.110
(But he may have been able to teach a heliocentric
astronomy as a thought experiment.

00:03:49.110 --> 00:03:50.290
Historians aren’t sure.)

00:03:50.290 --> 00:03:53.190
But Galileo wasn’t having any of it.

00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:58.000
In 1623, Galileo published a pamphlet called
the Assayer that basically said scientists

00:03:58.000 --> 00:03:59.680
should be free to do their work.

00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:03.250
Pope Urban VIII, Galileo’s personal friend,
was a fan.

00:04:03.250 --> 00:04:07.550
He said that God could move the heavens in
numberless ways, so the ultimate source of

00:04:07.550 --> 00:04:09.650
truth would always be faith.

00:04:09.650 --> 00:04:13.890
So sure, Galileo, you want to spend your nights
staring at tiny dots of light?

00:04:13.890 --> 00:04:14.900
Knock yourself out.

00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:19.600
Urban even renamed Galileo’s next book,
Dialogue on the the Two Chief World Systems

00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:21.199
of 1632.

00:04:21.199 --> 00:04:25.860
All Urban asked was for his friend to treat
different astronomical systems fairly.

00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:26.860
But…

00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:28.279
Galileo picked a fight.

00:04:28.279 --> 00:04:34.729
The Dialogue made a clear argument for Copernicanism,
comparing it point by point with the Aristotelian–Ptolemaic

00:04:34.729 --> 00:04:35.729
system.

00:04:35.729 --> 00:04:39.900
He brought new data to the battle: he described
the phases of Venus, which appears to grow

00:04:39.900 --> 00:04:42.520
larger and smaller like earth’s moon.

00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:45.460
This phasing did not fit with a geocentric
model.

00:04:45.460 --> 00:04:50.860
An even stronger argument came from the tides,
whose movements seemed to prove that the earth

00:04:50.860 --> 00:04:51.860
moves.

00:04:51.860 --> 00:04:54.110
And the pope was not happy.

00:04:54.110 --> 00:04:57.229
Urban felt that Galileo had not heard his
warning.

00:04:57.229 --> 00:04:59.719
All copies of the Dialogue were recalled.

00:04:59.719 --> 00:05:04.139
And in 1632, Galileo was called to Rome to
speak to the Inquisition.

00:05:04.139 --> 00:05:09.550
His trial got under way in 1633, and in time,
he was placed under house arrest for the rest

00:05:09.550 --> 00:05:10.550
of his life.

00:05:10.550 --> 00:05:12.590
Amazingly, Galileo didn’t give up.

00:05:12.590 --> 00:05:15.870
Humiliated, under arrest, he kept sciencing.

00:05:15.870 --> 00:05:20.410
Beyond his contributions to astronomy, physics,
and the scientific method, Galileo is a rockstar

00:05:20.410 --> 00:05:22.080
thanks to his fearlessness.

00:05:22.080 --> 00:05:27.839
Galileo’s last text was also perhaps his
most relevant to the idea of methods in science:

00:05:27.839 --> 00:05:33.220
His Two New Sciences of 1638 was a mathematical
treatise about how bodies fall through the

00:05:33.220 --> 00:05:35.400
air, and how wooden beams break.

00:05:35.400 --> 00:05:39.660
It was also a record of the process by which
he discovered these physical laws.

00:05:39.660 --> 00:05:43.789
He called for specific tests that would let
experimenters confirm his laws with their

00:05:43.789 --> 00:05:45.020
own senses.

00:05:45.020 --> 00:05:50.840
This, in his words, was the mark of a “true
scientist”: independent confirmation.

00:05:50.840 --> 00:05:53.819
This is an awesome norm to try to live up
to!

00:05:53.819 --> 00:05:57.930
So, we shouldn’t be surprised that a lifelong
nerd like Galileo would have played a critical

00:05:57.930 --> 00:06:00.339
role in developing better methods of doing
science.

00:06:00.339 --> 00:06:05.819
But Francis Bacon, born in London in 1561,
is more of a historical surprise.

00:06:05.819 --> 00:06:09.349
For one, he was cast out of public office
for taking bribes.

00:06:09.349 --> 00:06:11.569
Two, some people for some reason think he
was Shakespeare.

00:06:11.569 --> 00:06:16.349
And I mean, if you’ve ever read these two
writers… there’s a clear difference.

00:06:16.349 --> 00:06:20.240
And most of Bacon’s impact on science was
posthumous.

00:06:20.240 --> 00:06:24.240
We can basically boil it to down to a new
approach to science, which was practical,

00:06:24.240 --> 00:06:26.500
instrumental, and supported by the state.

00:06:26.500 --> 00:06:31.219
Bacon wanted to create a whole replacement
system of natural philosophy—that meant

00:06:31.219 --> 00:06:34.860
philosophy, mathematics, physics, biology,
all wrapped up together.

00:06:34.860 --> 00:06:39.870
He rejected the Aristotelian way of doing
science—arguing rationally using logic.

00:06:39.870 --> 00:06:44.969
Instead, he believed that natural philosophers
should help improve the wellbeing of humanity

00:06:44.969 --> 00:06:46.650
through technological advances.

00:06:46.650 --> 00:06:52.979
Bacon expressed this within a Christian framework,
casting Aristotle’s philosophy as a dereliction

00:06:52.979 --> 00:06:56.270
of the Christian duty of charity toward others.

00:06:56.270 --> 00:07:00.509
Improving wellbeing meant understanding and
controlling the chaos of the natural.

00:07:00.509 --> 00:07:06.349
Bacon described nature as female and passive,
and humanity as male and active.

00:07:06.349 --> 00:07:11.440
So, science was supposed to be a masculine
activity: it allowed humans to exploit nature.

00:07:11.440 --> 00:07:16.229
Now, this metaphor has not aged well at all,
and not just because it was sexist and horrible.

00:07:16.229 --> 00:07:22.119
We also now have plenty of examples of all
the ways that humans simply can’t control

00:07:22.119 --> 00:07:23.119
nature.

00:07:23.119 --> 00:07:25.300
And yet this metaphor is, sadly, still very
much alive.

00:07:25.300 --> 00:07:26.300
So.

00:07:26.300 --> 00:07:29.830
What did Bacon’s new system of natural philosophy
look like up close?

00:07:29.830 --> 00:07:31.189
Help us out, ThoughtBubble:

00:07:31.189 --> 00:07:35.699
For Bacon, control over nature meant deriving
useful arts—or technē—like gunpowder,

00:07:35.699 --> 00:07:38.770
silk, and the printing press, from basic knowledge.

00:07:38.770 --> 00:07:41.800
And how were Baconians supposed to make useful
knowledge?

00:07:41.800 --> 00:07:44.270
They needed first-hand experiences.

00:07:44.270 --> 00:07:49.960
This meant testing answers to important questions,
without relying on the words of long-dead

00:07:49.960 --> 00:07:52.059
Greek and Arabic philosophers.

00:07:52.059 --> 00:07:56.169
For Bacon, science also required central planning
and state support.

00:07:56.169 --> 00:08:00.300
Natural philosophy should not be the domain
of a few random nobles, he thought.

00:08:00.300 --> 00:08:03.960
It should be a program, or system, that worked
for the public good.

00:08:03.960 --> 00:08:09.580
He outlined a vision of a utopian science
bureaucracy in his book called New Atlantis,

00:08:09.580 --> 00:08:11.800
published in 1626.

00:08:11.800 --> 00:08:18.069
Bacon proposed creating a hub for intellectual
work, a kind of super-university called Salomon’s

00:08:18.069 --> 00:08:19.069
House.

00:08:19.069 --> 00:08:23.729
Here, the personnel—all male, of course—would
be strictly segregated into specific roles.

00:08:23.729 --> 00:08:26.120
Some would travel the world to gather facts.

00:08:26.120 --> 00:08:29.000
Others would conduct experiments to generate
new facts.

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:33.610
Yet others would extract potential facts from
books—but these proto-facts would have to

00:08:33.610 --> 00:08:35.430
be tested experimentally.

00:08:35.430 --> 00:08:40.060
Further up the hierarchy, others would analyze
all of the different natural facts and experimental

00:08:40.060 --> 00:08:42.570
outcomes and direct the next round of research.

00:08:42.570 --> 00:08:48.589
And at the very top were the Interpreters
of Nature—three men who would take all facts

00:08:48.589 --> 00:08:51.139
and use them to produce axioms.

00:08:51.139 --> 00:08:55.130
Working along with them were “dowry men”
who drew conclusions from these axioms to

00:08:55.130 --> 00:08:56.720
yield specific practical benefits.

00:08:56.720 --> 00:09:01.040
That, in a nutshell, is the scientific world
according to Bacon.

00:09:01.040 --> 00:09:04.050
Thanks Thought Bubble, Now, another thinker who advocated for a practical

00:09:04.050 --> 00:09:06.069
science was René Descartes.

00:09:06.069 --> 00:09:10.160
Born in central France in 1596, Descartes
lived mostly in the Netherlands.

00:09:10.160 --> 00:09:13.980
He’s known as a founding figure in mathematics
and modern philosophy.

00:09:13.980 --> 00:09:15.280
So, that's not bad.

00:09:15.280 --> 00:09:18.579
In math, he’s known as the dude who bridged
geometry and algebra.

00:09:18.579 --> 00:09:23.300
We call the numbered X–Y axes the plane
of “Cartesian” coordinates.

00:09:23.300 --> 00:09:25.230
You can map a lot of math with this system.

00:09:25.230 --> 00:09:29.380
Now, Descartes knew what had happened to Galileo,
and his publishers in France didn’t want

00:09:29.380 --> 00:09:30.930
to wind up on trial, too.

00:09:30.930 --> 00:09:36.350
So Descartes stopped publication of his own
Copernican book, Le monde or The World, in

00:09:36.350 --> 00:09:37.350
1633.

00:09:37.350 --> 00:09:42.639
But he did come up with a whole new cosmology,
based on Copernicus, that featured a chaotic,

00:09:42.639 --> 00:09:47.670
rapidly moving ætherial fluid in which the
planets and stars were suspended—instead

00:09:47.670 --> 00:09:49.630
of perfect crystalline spheres.

00:09:49.630 --> 00:09:54.199
His Discourse on Method, published in 1637,
was his major contribution to the history

00:09:54.199 --> 00:09:55.199
of making knowledge.

00:09:55.199 --> 00:09:59.990
But, more than Galileo—a practicing experimentalist—or
Bacon—a statesman thinking about the practical

00:09:59.990 --> 00:10:03.930
uses of natural philosophy—Descartes was
a pure philosopher.

00:10:03.930 --> 00:10:09.290
He started at the very beginning with an abstract
question: how we know what we know?

00:10:09.290 --> 00:10:14.230
This is question at the heart of the philosophical
discipline of epistemology, which Descartes

00:10:14.230 --> 00:10:15.980
redefined.

00:10:15.980 --> 00:10:19.350
Philosophers today are still debating some
of the questions Descartes raised about the

00:10:19.350 --> 00:10:20.490
origins of knowledge.

00:10:20.490 --> 00:10:24.020
Descartes wanted to replace Aristotle as the
king of philosophy.

00:10:24.020 --> 00:10:29.060
And Descartes’s attack on Aristotle boiled
down to two arguments: one, knowledge obtained

00:10:29.060 --> 00:10:34.100
through the senses lacks absolute certainty,
because the senses often deceive us.

00:10:34.100 --> 00:10:37.100
And two, human reason can also be deceived!

00:10:37.100 --> 00:10:41.650
Logical conclusions from false premises will
lead you to the wrong answers.

00:10:41.650 --> 00:10:47.580
So Descartes was like, welp, time to formulate a whole
new philosophy to address these points.

00:10:47.580 --> 00:10:52.950
Ultimately, to be certain of the truth, Descartes
could only count on one thing: his mind.

00:10:52.950 --> 00:10:58.060
So he described the world reductionistically,
meaning using math to represent physical phenomena.

00:10:58.060 --> 00:11:03.569
Only math, which is either right or wrong,
could found a total system of natural philosophy.

00:11:03.569 --> 00:11:08.230
For Descartes, the universe is composed only
of things that math can describe.

00:11:08.230 --> 00:11:12.730
He thought that philosophers should be able
to provide causal explanations for all observed

00:11:12.730 --> 00:11:16.629
phenomena, showing the or the mechanical
principles behind the things that happen in

00:11:16.629 --> 00:11:17.629
the universe.

00:11:17.629 --> 00:11:21.460
And the tactic Descartes used for checking
the validity of your own knowledge is famous

00:11:21.460 --> 00:11:24.620
and still useful today: systematic doubting.

00:11:24.620 --> 00:11:27.000
When in doubt, doubt yourself!

00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:32.430
This pairs nicely with what Bacon argued:
don’t trust old books; check!

00:11:32.430 --> 00:11:37.740
When you add Galileo’s focus on independent,
rational comparison of theories about natural

00:11:37.740 --> 00:11:43.440
phenomena to Bacon’s focus on experiment
and social norms promoting scientific research,

00:11:43.440 --> 00:11:48.480
and then Descartes’s reminder to always
ask yourself how sure you are that you know

00:11:48.480 --> 00:11:51.550
stuff, you get a kind of method or system.

00:11:51.550 --> 00:11:54.069
Was it thought of as a single philosophy at
the time?

00:11:54.069 --> 00:11:55.069
Sort of.

00:11:55.069 --> 00:11:58.839
Some of the most important members of the
early Royal Society, where we’ll head in

00:11:58.839 --> 00:12:03.089
a couple of episodes, pointed explicitly to
Bacon as an inspiration.

00:12:03.089 --> 00:12:07.240
But this story isn’t all all about better
descriptions of the Solar System.

00:12:07.240 --> 00:12:11.430
It’s also about winning wars and conquering
new territory.

00:12:11.430 --> 00:12:12.940
Stay tuned.

00:12:12.940 --> 00:12:16.649
Next time—we’ll look at how the “new
science” affected the healing arts and beliefs

00:12:16.649 --> 00:12:20.490
about the human form… and, yes, there will
be dissections.

00:12:20.490 --> 00:12:22.760
A lot of dissections!

00:12:22.760 --> 00:12:26.670
Crash Course History of Science is filmed
in the Dr. Cheryl C. Kinney studio in Missoula,

00:12:26.670 --> 00:12:30.860
Montana and it’s made with the help of all
this nice people and our animation team is

00:12:30.860 --> 00:12:31.860
Thought Cafe.

00:12:31.860 --> 00:12:33.149
Crash Course is a Complexly production.

00:12:33.149 --> 00:12:37.029

with us, you can check out some of our other

00:12:37.029 --> 00:12:40.600
channels like Scishow, Nature League, and
The Financial Diet.

00:12:40.600 --> 00:12:44.820
