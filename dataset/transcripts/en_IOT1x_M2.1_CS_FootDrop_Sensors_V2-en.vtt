SHIVA SHARIF BIDABADI: This system which has

00:00:03.980 --> 00:00:07.180
been designed for this specific study is a kind

00:00:07.180 --> 00:00:11.140
of a device using three separate IMU devices placed

00:00:11.140 --> 00:00:14.680
in three color coded 3D printed boxes.

00:00:14.680 --> 00:00:19.270
And the sensors will be attached to the different sections of the lower limb.

00:00:19.270 --> 00:00:23.530
For example, in this case, thigh, shank, and foot off the subject.

00:00:23.530 --> 00:00:29.020
And the data from this device will be captured simultaneously

00:00:29.020 --> 00:00:32.860
to the receiver dongle that connects to the laptop

00:00:32.860 --> 00:00:35.320
and collects the data from the devices.

00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:38.990
Having this device attached to the body section,

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:42.040
we can provide some information about the movement

00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:43.460
of that section of the body.

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:46.900
For example, angle of the thigh during the walking trial.

00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:53.765
For example, positive and negative movements in the whole gait cycle.

00:00:53.765 --> 00:00:57.430
The sensors in the devices are Inertial Measurement Units

00:00:57.430 --> 00:01:02.020
which is a kind of sensor that consists of accelerometer gyroscope,

00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:07.780
and magnetometer in a single unit that provides a good range of information

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:09.910
about the movement.

00:01:09.910 --> 00:01:16.070
Each three devices have the same sensor inside them, just numbered.

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:20.320
Accelerometer actually reads the acceleration of the device.

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:24.100
for the angle of velocity in different directions, x, y, and z.

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:28.120
And a magnetometer also looks for the magnetic field in the area.

00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:33.540
It could get noise easily by any magnetic field near the sensor.

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:36.970
But in general, the readings that we're going

00:01:36.970 --> 00:01:41.920
to have from the inertial measurement unit is the acceleration in three axes,

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:45.130
the magnetic field in three axis and also the angle

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:48.330
of velocity in three different axis.
