00:00:02.789 --> 00:00:05.080
SIMONE PETTIGREW: Probably the most substantial benefit

00:00:05.080 --> 00:00:08.620
that we can gain from autonomous vehicles is accident reduction.

00:00:08.620 --> 00:00:12.580
Around 93% of all accidents are just down to human error.

00:00:12.580 --> 00:00:15.310
So we go through stop signs or red lights.

00:00:15.310 --> 00:00:17.620
We don't see oncoming traffic, et cetera.

00:00:17.620 --> 00:00:21.730
Autonomous vehicles are expected to eradicate almost all

00:00:21.730 --> 00:00:23.470
of those accidents.

00:00:23.470 --> 00:00:28.150
In Australia, we lose about 1,200 people a year who die on the roads.

00:00:28.150 --> 00:00:31.030
If we can get rid of 93% of those accidents,

00:00:31.030 --> 00:00:34.130
you're saving more than 1,000 lives per year.

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:36.160
The other consideration, of course, are people

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:39.250
who don't die, but end up in hospital.

00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:41.950
Often, they're quite severe accidents, and they can be in rehab

00:00:41.950 --> 00:00:43.640
for the rest of their lives.

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:46.360
We have, again, about 34,000 Australians end up

00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:49.210
in hospital due to traffic accidents each year.

00:00:49.210 --> 00:00:52.570
If we can get rid of 93% of those hospital visits,

00:00:52.570 --> 00:00:57.310
that would be freeing up entire hospital wings and rehabilitation centers.

00:00:57.310 --> 00:01:00.130
The ongoing benefits to society will be huge,

00:01:00.130 --> 00:01:02.440
as well as for those individuals who won't be

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:04.489
harmed who would have been otherwise.

00:01:04.489 --> 00:01:09.430
The cost savings are expected to be around $16 billion a year

00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:11.860
just in crash prevention alone.

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:14.980
If we think about the fact that we have an aging population,

00:01:14.980 --> 00:01:16.480
and it's aging rapidly.

00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:18.490
We've got that huge baby boomer segment that's

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:19.930
just entered the retirement years.

00:01:19.930 --> 00:01:23.980
Autonomous vehicles are understood to be a huge boon for this group.

00:01:23.980 --> 00:01:27.070
They'll actually be able to stay a lot more mobile for a lot longer

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:30.640
once they can use vehicles that don't rely on their faculties

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:31.840
to be able to drive.

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:34.930
So lots of potential there to do lots of wonderful things

00:01:34.930 --> 00:01:37.630
to help people who are really quite disadvantaged, particularly,

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:40.660
say, blind people, who have never had the opportunity to go anywhere

00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:43.930
on their own in a vehicle, would be able to, with voice activation,

00:01:43.930 --> 00:01:47.640
just be able to program a vehicle to take them wherever they wanted to go.

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:49.140
SCOTT HOLLIER: I'm Dr Scott Hollier.

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:51.261
I'm a digital access specialist.

00:01:51.261 --> 00:01:54.010
I've worked in the corporate government and not-for-profit sectors

00:01:54.010 --> 00:01:57.060
for about 15 years, and a big part of my focus

00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:58.810
is to ensure that people with disabilities

00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:01.810
get access to computers and internet-related technologies.

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:05.860
Autonomous vehicles offer a huge potential for people with disabilities.

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:08.860
As a legally blind person, I'm very much looking forward to the day

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:11.870
when I'll be able to jump into an autonomous vehicle

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:14.244
and it can take me to where I want to go.

00:02:14.244 --> 00:02:16.660
It's not only beneficial in terms of getting me somewhere,

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:22.640
but it also helps to address issues that I face now, such as my current need

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:24.730
to live near public transport.

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:29.290
It's exciting to that if I did have a driverless car an autonomous vehicle

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:32.680
that I could potentially live anywhere because I'm no longer restricted

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:36.530
by that need to be close to shops or close to public transport.

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:42.160
So the benefits would really open up for someone such as myself.

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:45.200
I think one of the benefits of autonomous vehicles

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:48.250
is that it does provide a lot of independence.

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:51.130
Again, to use myself as an example, to have the ability

00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:56.770
to just pop to the shops, or be able to go watch my son play soccer,

00:02:56.770 --> 00:02:59.410
or my daughter play golf, without the need

00:02:59.410 --> 00:03:06.910
to have significant coordination of going places, given that I can't drive,

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:09.190
it would be great to be able to just jump in the car

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:13.010
and go places, something which I can't do at the moment.

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:16.540
So I think it does give you a lot of flexibility, a lot of independence.

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:19.480
The timing becomes a lot easier.

00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:21.935
For people, for example, who use a wheelchair

00:03:21.935 --> 00:03:25.270
and rely a lot on wheelchair taxis, autonomous vehicles

00:03:25.270 --> 00:03:28.640
mean they'd be able to better manage the time.

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:33.700
They don't have to rely on how quickly or how far away a taxi is,

00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:39.050
and be able to just go in something and do what you want to do.

00:03:39.050 --> 00:03:43.600
So it would significantly help in relation to independence.

00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:45.567
SIMONE PETTIGREW: Like every other innovation,

00:03:45.567 --> 00:03:46.900
there are going to be downsides.

00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:49.390
And we're going to need to work through those to make sure

00:03:49.390 --> 00:03:51.260
that they're not disadvantaging people.

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:53.470
So as we said, one of them is that perhaps people

00:03:53.470 --> 00:03:55.420
will end up using cars more rather than less,

00:03:55.420 --> 00:03:58.720
because they've become more dependent on them, because they're so convenient.

00:03:58.720 --> 00:04:01.180
Other risks include things like carjacking,

00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:05.740
where you could worry about people who are very technology-savvy infiltrating

00:04:05.740 --> 00:04:10.060
a system and commanding vehicles to all turn 90 degrees right now and run

00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:11.710
into brick walls or people.

00:04:11.710 --> 00:04:14.020
Those kinds of scenarios are very unlikely.

00:04:14.020 --> 00:04:16.436
We have lots of agencies in Australia and internationally

00:04:16.436 --> 00:04:19.269
that are working very hard on making sure that those kinds of issues

00:04:19.269 --> 00:04:22.330
don't occur, and perhaps think back to our airplane

00:04:22.330 --> 00:04:25.900
example, in that those systems also have to be hijack-proof.

00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:29.570
So we are accustomed to coming up with systems to get around that,

00:04:29.570 --> 00:04:32.440
but it does take a lot of effort and some very big brains

00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:34.820
out there to be working on that constantly,

00:04:34.820 --> 00:04:38.014
and to be preempting any kind of problems that may occur.

00:04:38.014 --> 00:04:40.930
PAUL NICHOLLS: One of the great things about autonomous vehicle trials

00:04:40.930 --> 00:04:44.080
is it also helps us to better understand the privacy

00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:46.549
concerns of the people that use it.

00:04:46.549 --> 00:04:48.340
With an autonomous vehicle trial, there are

00:04:48.340 --> 00:04:52.360
lots of sensors collecting lots of information about the individuals.

00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:54.670
There are cameras on board the actual system.

00:04:54.670 --> 00:04:57.490
There are cameras on the external of the system.

00:04:57.490 --> 00:04:59.860
We actually are very careful to make sure

00:04:59.860 --> 00:05:02.300
that people are aware that their data is being collected.

00:05:02.300 --> 00:05:05.860
SIMONE PETTIGREW: We've been surveying Australians for the last year or so.

00:05:05.860 --> 00:05:10.250
We've surveyed around 1,600 Australian drivers aged 16-plus,

00:05:10.250 --> 00:05:13.380
and we've said to them, what do you know about autonomous vehicles?

00:05:13.380 --> 00:05:14.660
How do you feel about them?

00:05:14.660 --> 00:05:16.280
What do you think the biggest positives are?

00:05:16.280 --> 00:05:18.113
What do you think the biggest negatives are?

00:05:18.113 --> 00:05:22.370
Fortunately, the overall attitude seems to be reasonably neutral.

00:05:22.370 --> 00:05:26.231
So on a five-point scale, most people were kind of around three saying,

00:05:26.231 --> 00:05:27.980
I think I'm interested, but I'm really not

00:05:27.980 --> 00:05:29.521
quite sure what's involved with this.

00:05:29.521 --> 00:05:31.910
So there's a huge opportunity there for public education

00:05:31.910 --> 00:05:33.980
so that people are better informed.

00:05:33.980 --> 00:05:38.510
Where they did express benefits and concerns, the benefits, in general,

00:05:38.510 --> 00:05:39.770
outweighed the concerns.

00:05:39.770 --> 00:05:42.770
So they tended to see more positives than they could see negatives.

00:05:42.770 --> 00:05:47.990
And by far, the biggest positive is this ability for immobile people

00:05:47.990 --> 00:05:51.360
to be able to be freed up to go where they want to go.

00:05:51.360 --> 00:05:54.814
The biggest concern that people have, interestingly, is around job losses.

00:05:54.814 --> 00:05:57.230
So they're very aware, of course, that autonomous vehicles

00:05:57.230 --> 00:05:58.910
will no longer require drivers.

00:05:58.910 --> 00:06:02.460
So if you're a truck driver, if you're a taxi, or an Uber driver,

00:06:02.460 --> 00:06:06.260
if you're a courier, you won't have a job in the longer term

00:06:06.260 --> 00:06:08.490
once all vehicles are automated.

00:06:08.490 --> 00:06:11.310
So people are quite aware that that's going to be an outcome.

00:06:11.310 --> 00:06:15.230
And again, that brings us back to our governments

00:06:15.230 --> 00:06:18.260
being very proactive in this space and seeing that this is coming,

00:06:18.260 --> 00:06:21.470
and making sure that we have kind of retraining or other opportunities

00:06:21.470 --> 00:06:22.810
available for people.

00:06:22.810 --> 00:06:25.730
And overall, internationally, the big studies

00:06:25.730 --> 00:06:28.640
have shown that the net employment outcome is going to be positive.

00:06:28.640 --> 00:06:30.650
We're going to have more jobs rather than fewer,

00:06:30.650 --> 00:06:32.270
but they're going to be based in IT.

00:06:32.270 --> 00:06:34.700
Connected autonomous vehicles are coming.

00:06:34.700 --> 00:06:35.940
There's no doubt about it.

00:06:35.940 --> 00:06:36.690
We're going to have them here.

00:06:36.690 --> 00:06:38.040
And it's a really, really good thing.

00:06:38.040 --> 00:06:40.850
They're going to have amazing effects in terms of almost completely

00:06:40.850 --> 00:06:44.910
eradicating traffic accidents, in terms of allowing people who otherwise can't

00:06:44.910 --> 00:06:47.780
be mobile to be independent and get where they need to go,

00:06:47.780 --> 00:06:50.110
in terms of reducing the number of emissions,

00:06:50.110 --> 00:06:54.050
so that we've actually got a much healthier city to live in, and also

00:06:54.050 --> 00:06:58.550
in terms of flexibility, allowing us to use our travel time for leisure

00:06:58.550 --> 00:07:01.357
or for additional work to increase our productivity.

00:07:01.357 --> 00:07:02.690
They're going to be a real boon.

00:07:02.690 --> 00:07:04.550
They're going to change the way our cities are laid out.

00:07:04.550 --> 00:07:06.320
They're going to change the way that our homes look.

00:07:06.320 --> 00:07:07.320
Will they have a garage?

00:07:07.320 --> 00:07:10.400
Or will they not, if we're using group vehicles?

00:07:10.400 --> 00:07:12.530
The ability of those vehicles to talk to each other

00:07:12.530 --> 00:07:17.190
will increase the efficiency of our road systems and reduce congestion.

00:07:17.190 --> 00:07:19.120
So it's a good thing.
