[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:03.900 --> 00:00:08.440
SPEAKER 1: Using the simulation tools available in Cisco Packet Tracer,

00:00:08.440 --> 00:00:12.390
we're going to set up some basic scenarios where

00:00:12.390 --> 00:00:17.310
connected devices can form a useful system

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:19.950
in the style of the Internet of Things.

00:00:19.950 --> 00:00:25.930
So starting by adding a few devices to our workspace.

00:00:25.930 --> 00:00:34.660
Looking at end devices, across here, we'll have a smartphone.

00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:40.060
And, going back to the network devices, if we'll take a wireless device

00:00:40.060 --> 00:00:45.190
category and put a cell tower in place.

00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:51.100
So this combination of a smartphone and the cell tower

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:57.560
can help a person control, or monitor, devices in other places.

00:00:57.560 --> 00:01:01.510
So these two can just sit off to the side for the moment.

00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:10.070
And then, let's simulate some end devices within a home.

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:17.000
We'll start by putting in an air conditioner, the front door

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:21.950
of the house, which is locked.

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:27.511
Red means locked, green unlocked.

00:01:27.511 --> 00:01:32.000
Open and close the door by holding down Alt button and clicking.

00:01:34.980 --> 00:01:43.530
We'll put in the coffee maker and, for all this to connect,

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:48.720
go back to Network Devices, Wireless Devices.

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:51.260
Let's go with the standard home gateway.

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:55.370
This allows the house to connect to the internet,

00:01:55.370 --> 00:02:00.200
acting as a wireless access point and a router,

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:06.230
so that we have the link between here and the person with their smartphone

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:09.120
via our cell tower.

00:02:09.120 --> 00:02:16.340
So you can see the uses, in this case, as someone is getting closer to home.

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:23.840
The smartphone can either be set to automatically detect their location,

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:30.800
unlock the door, switch the air conditioner on, switch

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:38.870
the coffeemaker on, or it can be manually set to this using apps

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:41.410
within the smartphone.
