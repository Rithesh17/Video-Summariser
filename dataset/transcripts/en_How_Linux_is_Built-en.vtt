00:00:06.800 --> 00:00:10.340
You use Linux every day, whether you know it or not.

00:00:10.340 --> 00:00:16.220
Over 850,000 Android phones running Linux are activated every single day.

00:00:16.220 --> 00:00:20.540
Compare that to just 30,000 Windows phones, according to the latest reports.

00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:26.220
That means 100 Android devices have come online just since you started watching this video.

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:32.060
Nearly 700,000 TVs are sold every day, most of which are running Linux.

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:35.320
8 out of 10 financial trades are powered by Linux.

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:38.780
9 out of 10 of the world's supercomputers run Linux.

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:43.940
Google, Twitter, Facebook, and Amazon are all powered by Linux.

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:47.720
So, how is Linux developed to achieve all of this?

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:51.879
Unlike other operating systems, like Windows or IOS,

00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:57.480
Linux is built collaboratively across companies, geographies, and markets,

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:02.080
resulting in the largest collaborative development project in the history of computing.

00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:10.680
Just since 2005, about 8,000 developers from almost 800 companies have contributed to the Linux kernel.

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:18.800
These contributions have resulted in 15 million lines of code, 1.5 million lines written in just the last couple of years.

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:23.780
Consider that Homer's ethic Iliad poem is a mere 15,000 lines of text.

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:28.120
The novel War and Peace just 560,000 words.

00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:31.480
But it's not just about the sheer number of lines of code.

00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:34.920
It's also about how quickly Linux is developed and released.

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:39.040
For example, a major new kernel comes out every 2-3 months.

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:42.160
Compare this to years for computing operating systems.

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:46.360
This is made possible by a unique collaborative development process.

00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:52.220
When submitting code to the Linux kernel, developers break changes into individual unit called patches.

00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:57.040
A patch describes the lines that need to be changed, added or removed from the source code.

00:01:57.040 --> 00:02:04.800
Each patch can add a new feature, new support for a device, fix a problem, improve performance, or rework things to be more easily understood.

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:10.540
Developers post their patches to the relevant mailing lists, where other developers can reply with feedback.

00:02:10.540 --> 00:02:20.480
When the patch is close to being release-ready, it is accepted by a senior Linux kernel developer or maintainer, who manages one or more of the 100 different sections of the kernel.

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:25.200
While this isn't a guarantee that it will go to the mainline, it is certainly a good sign.

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:28.140
Here it gets an even more extensive evaluation.

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:32.500
When the maintainer finishes their review, he or she will sign off on the patch,

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:41.700
and send it on to Linux creator and Linux Foundation Fellow Linux Torvalds, who has the ultimate authority on what is accepted into the next release, and what is not.

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:45.880
Nearly 10,000 patches go into almost every new release.

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:49.431
About 6 patches are applied to the kernel each hour.

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:53.240
Linux's rate of development is simply unmatched.

00:02:53.240 --> 00:03:01.600
Today, Linux is dominating on mobile devices, in the enterprise, and web infrastructure, data centers, super computing and more.

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:05.280
What's next? Because together, we're ready.
