MALCOLM HAYES: I'm Malcolm Hayes.

00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:13.720
I'm a dairy farmer from Cookernup in Western Australia.

00:00:13.720 --> 00:00:18.960
The property here, our home property or what we call our dairy platform,

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:21.640
is about 240 hectares.

00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:26.230
Presently, we're milking about 360 cows in the dairy,

00:00:26.230 --> 00:00:29.880
producing about three and a half million liters of milk a year.

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:34.080
Last year about this time, after a lot of searching around

00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:38.460
for a better system, we decided to go with a GEA cow management system

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:45.300
where we installed milk monitors and automatic ID systems on our cows,

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:49.470
which it's actually reducing the labor that we need to use in the dairy.

00:00:49.470 --> 00:00:53.320
And we're actually managing the cows a lot better than we did before.

00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:57.480
With the better management, we're certainly getting our cows in calf

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:01.590
better, as we have a system to identify cows which are on heat.

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:03.290

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:05.990
All of the cows have a responder on, them

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:12.005
which is a thing which has a motion sensor in it and a transponder in it

00:01:12.005 --> 00:01:14.630
to actually register the, so the computer

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:17.660
can read the cow's number as the cow comes in the dairy.

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:21.000
This is how we know what goes on individually with each cow.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:25.490
If a cow gets sick and milk drops off, alarms will come up in the dairy.

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:27.740
And we'll know straight away.

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:31.670
If she stops eating because there's no motion or lack of motion in the cow,

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:33.060
we'll know straight away.

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:35.150
It even has an app that goes to my phone that I

00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:38.710
can look up the cows when I'm away.
