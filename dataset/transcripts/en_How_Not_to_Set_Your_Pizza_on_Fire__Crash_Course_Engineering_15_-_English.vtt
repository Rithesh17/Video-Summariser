00:00:03.100 --> 00:00:04.260
Temperature matters.

00:00:04.260 --> 00:00:10.160
In almost everything we do, we’re trying
to heat something up, cool something down,
or just trying to maintain a temperature.

00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:16.140
As an engineer, you’ll often need to find
that Goldilocks temperature, the one that’s
“just right” for your devices and designs.

00:00:16.140 --> 00:00:18.720
But once you figure that out, how do you achieve it?

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:21.800
Well, you’ll need some equipment, and to
learn how to use it.

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:27.240
More specifically, you’ll need to know about
heat exchangers, and how they can affect
heat transfer.

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:30.020
Just make sure to watch out for those three
bears.

00:00:30.020 --> 00:00:40.220
[Theme Music]

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:46.000
So far in this course, we’ve learned a good
deal about heat transfer and the different ways
heat moves throughout our world.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:51.620
We’ve also talked a bit about the devices
that help move heat energy, like refrigerators
and heat pumps,

00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:54.680
and how you can slow down the transfer of
heat with layers of insulation.

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:57.920
But that’s just the beginning of the ways
you can affect heat transfer!

00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:02.440
There are lots of different types of equipment
you can use to transfer heat between two things.

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:06.200
They’re called heat exchangers, because
they exchange heat.

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:08.860
But don’t let the simplicity of the name
fool you.

00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:10.700
Heat exchangers are everywhere.

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:16.840
They show up as radiators in cars, where they
transfer heat energy away from the engine so
it doesn’t...overheat.

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:20.119
You’ll also find them in military equipment
and power supplies.

00:01:20.119 --> 00:01:22.020
You can even find them in medical devices.

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:23.280
Have you ever had an X-ray?

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:31.000
Well, X-rays actually produce a large amount of heat,
so they need heat exchangers to draw that heat away
and keep it from damaging the equipment.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:37.980
Even when you create something amazing – something
that can literally see the bones under your skin – you
still have to account for its byproducts.

00:01:37.980 --> 00:01:42.000
Engineers can’t just make a good meal;
we have to clean up the kitchen, too.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.260
So heat exchangers are pretty important.

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:47.080
Without them, there’s all kinds of stuff
we wouldn’t be able to do.

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:50.460
And the type of heat exchanger you use is
even more important,

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:55.320
because it’s not always as simple as heating
something up or cooling it down in any way
that you can.

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:56.860
There’s a lot more to consider.

00:01:56.860 --> 00:02:00.880
For example, let’s say you want to heat
up your leftovers from last night.

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:09.140
Technically, you could do that by setting your
pizza on fire, but unless you’d like your crust
extra crispy, that seems a bit extreme.

00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:11.360
A much better choice would be a microwave.

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:12.340
Maybe an oven.

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:16.060
Or, say your tea is a little too hot to drink
and you want to cool it down.

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:22.360
You could blast it with a firehose of cold
water, but that would likely ruin your tea,
and everything else around it.

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:27.790
It would probably be better to just wait a
bit – maybe put your tea in a colder room
or leave it in the refrigerator.

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:31.040
In engineering, you need tools and methods
that are more precise.

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:34.020
Surgeons have their scalpels; we have heat
exchangers.

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:35.620
So let’s look at the ones we’ve got!

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:39.720
The first, and most basic example of a heat
exchanger is a concentric tube.

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:48.320
Here, one pipe or tube is placed inside another one,
with a colder fluid moving through the center tube, and
a warmer fluid moving through the outer tube.

00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:51.000
This fluid might be a liquid, or it could
be a gas.

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:55.870
A common place you’d find concentric tube
heat exchangers is inside air conditioners.

00:02:55.870 --> 00:03:04.500
With concentric tubes, and in most heat exchangers
you’ll encounter, it’s important to note that the two fluids
are sealed off from each other and never mix.

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:13.980
But as the fluids move down their separate tubes,
energy transfers from the hotter outer fluid to the
colder inner fluid through the wall of the inner tube.

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:15.500
That’s the heat transfer.

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:20.920
In some concentric tubes, the fluids will flow in
the same direction – what’s known as parallel flow –

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:25.060
and other times they’ll move in opposite
directions, which is called counterflow.

00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:29.340
Whichever way the fluid flows, You’ll probably
want to know just how good the heat transfer is.

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:31.500
That’s the point of a heat exchanger after
all.

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:34.920
There are two main equations for heat transfer
that you can use to figure this out.

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:43.220
The first looks at each fluid individually, and defines
heat transfer – represented with the letter Q – as the
product of three of the chosen fluid’s properties:

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:46.280
its mass flow rate, m, or how fast it’s
moving;

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:50.680
its heat capacity, c, or how much heat you
need to raise the fluid’s temperature;

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:54.960
and its change in temperature, ΔT, after
it passes through the heat exchanger.

00:03:54.960 --> 00:04:01.140
This equation tells you that no matter what,
if there’s a greater change in the fluid’s
temperature, there was more heat transfer.

00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:02.540
Which, obviously.

00:04:02.540 --> 00:04:09.430
It also tells you that there’s more heat
transfer if it’s a type of fluid that just generally
needs more heat to raise its temperature.

00:04:09.430 --> 00:04:15.520
Finally, it says that it takes more heat transfer
to accomplish a given temperature change in
a fluid that’s moving really fast.

00:04:15.520 --> 00:04:23.320
If each particle of fluid isn’t staying in the heat
exchanger for very long, you need more heat transfer
to raise its temperature quickly, before it leaves.

00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:31.220
Let’s say you have a heat exchanger with the colder
fluid in the inner tube moving at a high flow rate and
the warmer fluid in the outer tube moving slowly.

00:04:31.220 --> 00:04:38.400
Even if there’s plenty of heat being transferred,
you might not get a major temperature increase in
the inner tube since it has such a high flow rate.

00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:45.380
Meanwhile, all that heat being transferred to the
outer tube will cause a significant temperature
change, since it’s moving so slowly.

00:04:45.380 --> 00:04:46.900
Which is what we want!

00:04:46.900 --> 00:04:50.880
The whole point of a heat exchanger is to
accomplish that significant temperature change.

00:04:50.880 --> 00:04:57.910
Now, the other equation for heat transfer
also describes it in terms of three properties,
but it takes both fluids into account:

00:04:57.910 --> 00:05:06.460
The first property is the heat transfer coefficient, U,
which is a measure of how easily heat is transferred
between the fluids through whatever is separating them;

00:05:06.460 --> 00:05:10.120
second, there’s the area, A, over which
the heat transfers;

00:05:10.120 --> 00:05:15.520
and third, there’s the temperature difference,
ΔT, but this time between the two fluids.

00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:20.680
The heat transfer coefficient is actually the inverse
of the thermal resistance we discussed last time,

00:05:20.680 --> 00:05:26.000
so the larger the value for U, the less resistance
there is, allowing for more heat transfer.

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:32.380
This equation also tells you there’s more
heat transferred when there’s a greater area
of contact between the two fluids.

00:05:32.380 --> 00:05:37.600
And no matter what the heat transfer coefficient
is or how much contact there is between the two fluids,

00:05:37.600 --> 00:05:41.120
a greater temperature change will always
involve more heat.

00:05:41.120 --> 00:05:48.460
You can use these two different ways of defining
heat transfer to change your operating conditions as
necessary and get the heat transfer you need.

00:05:48.460 --> 00:05:55.860
In the design of the heat exchanger, you can affect
the heat transfer through the heat transfer coefficient
and the area of contact between the fluids.

00:05:55.860 --> 00:06:03.290
And while the heat exchanger is up and running, you can affect its heat transfer by the temperature differences between the fluids and their mass flow rates.

00:06:03.290 --> 00:06:08.000
But all of this leads to some inherent problems
with the simple concentric tube heat exchanger.

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:11.220
If the temperature difference between the
fluids is the driving force,

00:06:11.220 --> 00:06:17.500
then the heat exchanger will need to have an
appropriate area and U value to achieve a reasonable
amount of heat transfer.

00:06:17.500 --> 00:06:23.560
There are two ways to increase that heat
transfer: increase the value of U, or increase
the value of the area.

00:06:23.560 --> 00:06:31.660
You could increase the heat transfer coefficient by
using more conductive pipes or making them thinner,
but at a certain point you’ll hit a physical limit.

00:06:31.660 --> 00:06:38.240
Which leaves you with only one real way to
increase the heat transfer: increase the area
of contact between the fluids.

00:06:38.240 --> 00:06:45.460
For a concentric tube design, the only way to
increase the area is either by the pipe’s radius
or length, which isn’t too practical.

00:06:45.460 --> 00:06:48.400
For one thing, the heat exchanger will take
up more space.

00:06:48.400 --> 00:06:55.580
And it’s going to increase not only the cost of the
building materials, but the operating cost of any
pumps pushing the fluid through the device as well.

00:06:55.580 --> 00:07:04.120
If we only used concentric tubes in our designs, we’d
need more space under the hoods of our cars and our
X-ray machines would be even bigger and clunkier.

00:07:04.120 --> 00:07:06.900
So it’s worth looking at some other heat
exchanger designs too.

00:07:06.900 --> 00:07:16.140
Take finned tubes, for example, which you’ll often find in industrial applications like power plants, industrial dryers, and in the air conditioning units of large buildings.

00:07:16.140 --> 00:07:22.700
In these designs, fins are added to a tube to
increase its surface area, which enhances its
rate of heat transfer at the same time.

00:07:22.700 --> 00:07:25.080
There are two main types of finned tube designs.

00:07:25.080 --> 00:07:28.780
With axial fin structures, fins run along
the tube lengthwise.

00:07:28.780 --> 00:07:38.000
They’re best suited for devices where fluid flow outside
of the tube is slower and more viscous, like oil, but you
still want it to distribute a greater amount of energy.

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:45.400
With radial fin structures, on the other hand,
discs are added to the tube and spaced out from
each other, usually in regular intervals.

00:07:45.400 --> 00:07:50.600
This type of finned design is best suited
for a faster-moving fluid like air to flow
around the tube.

00:07:50.600 --> 00:07:57.680
Another heat exchanger worth looking at is
the plate heat exchanger, which uses metal
plates to transfer heat between fluids.

00:07:57.680 --> 00:08:05.020
With these, the warmer fluid flows through
one port and the colder fluid flows through
another, typically in counterflow.

00:08:05.020 --> 00:08:11.240
Both fluids are restricted by seals so they
can only follow a certain path, kind of snaking
their way through the exchanger.

00:08:11.240 --> 00:08:17.720
The fluid between each set of plates alternates,
with the plates providing a large surface area
for a high rate of heat transfer.

00:08:17.720 --> 00:08:25.940
So, plate heat exchangers would be a little better than
concentric tubes for something like an X-ray machine,
since it produces a lot of heat you’d want to get rid of.

00:08:25.940 --> 00:08:31.420
Now, both finned tubes and plate heat exchangers
are usually a step up from concentric tubes,

00:08:31.420 --> 00:08:34.760
but one of the most common heat exchangers is
the shell-and-tube design.

00:08:34.760 --> 00:08:41.250
You can find them practically anywhere, from
large oil refineries, to engines and transmissions,
and even in swimming pools.

00:08:41.250 --> 00:08:48.180
Like its name implies, a shell-and-tube heat
exchanger is made up of a larger shell with
a bundle of smaller tubes inside it.

00:08:48.180 --> 00:08:55.740
One fluid, usually the colder one, moves through
this series of tubes while another fluid flows
outside of them and through the shell.

00:08:55.740 --> 00:09:02.260
There would be large pockets of stagnant
shell-side fluid in the corners of the shell if
this design was left as-is, though.

00:09:02.260 --> 00:09:10.020
So you can put baffles, which are obstructing
vanes or panels, inside the shell to drive the
shell-side fluid through in a maze-like pattern.

00:09:10.020 --> 00:09:16.260
Baffles not only help to increase the overall
average heat transfer through the system by
directing the flow of the fluid,

00:09:16.260 --> 00:09:19.900
but also by increasing the shell-side velocity
and promoting turbulence.

00:09:19.900 --> 00:09:27.360
So, between concentric tubes, finned tubes, plates,
and shell-and-tube designs, you’ve got plenty of
options when you need to transfer heat.

00:09:27.360 --> 00:09:31.880
Which, among other things, means there’s
no need to set any pizza on fire.

00:09:31.880 --> 00:09:33.480
That would just be a travesty.

00:09:33.480 --> 00:09:38.900
Today we learned all about the different types
of heat exchangers and how they can be used
to transfer heat.

00:09:38.900 --> 00:09:45.880
We started off with concentric tubes , and
the two main equations that can help us define
heat transfer in heat exchangers.

00:09:45.880 --> 00:09:51.200
Then we flowed on over to finned tubes and
found the differences between axial or radial fins.

00:09:51.200 --> 00:09:56.720
Finally, we covered plate heat exchangers
and studied the most common heat
exchanger design: shell-and-tube.

00:09:56.720 --> 00:10:01.840
I’ll see you next time, when we’ll continue
on our journey and learn all about mass transfer.
