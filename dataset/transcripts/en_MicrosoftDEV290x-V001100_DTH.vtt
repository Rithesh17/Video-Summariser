00:00:00.920 --> 00:00:05.410
>> Mathematical morphology sounds complicated but it's really just

00:00:05.410 --> 00:00:09.715
about using mathematical operations to change or morph images.

00:00:09.715 --> 00:00:13.535
The first operation we are going to look at is called dilation.

00:00:13.535 --> 00:00:16.330
To see how this works, let's imagine we have

00:00:16.330 --> 00:00:17.920
a black and white image in which

00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:20.710
a pixel value of 255 indicates white,

00:00:20.710 --> 00:00:23.140
and zero indicates black.

00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:27.860
We start by creating a mask which we call a structuring element.

00:00:27.860 --> 00:00:30.400
This contains pixel values and has

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:32.615
a target cell called this origin,

00:00:32.615 --> 00:00:35.030
usually somewhere near the center.

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:37.870
In this case, our structuring element is

00:00:37.870 --> 00:00:40.010
a basic cross pattern of black cells.

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:41.785
But you can use any shape you like really

00:00:41.785 --> 00:00:44.930
depending on the effect you want to have on the image.

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:47.755
Now, we place the structuring element

00:00:47.755 --> 00:00:49.685
on the image just like a filter,

00:00:49.685 --> 00:00:51.340
and we look for pixels where

00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:52.915
the underlying image value

00:00:52.915 --> 00:00:55.855
matches the overlaid structuring element value.

00:00:55.855 --> 00:01:00.575
If we find any, we activate the target cell by setting it to zero.

00:01:00.575 --> 00:01:03.970
In other words, we're performing a logical OR-operation on

00:01:03.970 --> 00:01:05.845
any cell in the structuring element

00:01:05.845 --> 00:01:08.480
that matches a cell in the image.

00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:11.145
In this case, there are none,

00:01:11.145 --> 00:01:13.605
so we move on to the next cell.

00:01:13.605 --> 00:01:15.850
Now, the middle cell on the bottom row of

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:17.830
the mass contains a zero,

00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:19.945
and so does the corresponding image cell.

00:01:19.945 --> 00:01:23.710
So our criteria of finding any cells with a matching value is met,

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:26.885
and we set the target cell to zero.

00:01:26.885 --> 00:01:29.470
Let me just repeat the operation,

00:01:29.470 --> 00:01:30.950
convolving the mask across

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:34.025
the image until all the target cells are set.

00:01:34.025 --> 00:01:35.720
You can see from this that

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:37.970
the key effect of dilation is to enlarge

00:01:37.970 --> 00:01:39.980
images by extending pixels around

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:42.825
the edges and to fill-in small holes.

00:01:42.825 --> 00:01:45.205
Erosion, as its name suggests,

00:01:45.205 --> 00:01:46.790
is the opposite of dilation.

00:01:46.790 --> 00:01:49.810
It removes pixels in details from the image.

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:53.060
We'll start with the end result from our dilation process,

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:56.330
and once again, we'll apply a structuring element.

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:59.675
But this time when we compare the cells,

00:01:59.675 --> 00:02:01.705
we'll use a logical AND.

00:02:01.705 --> 00:02:03.810
In other words, we'll set the target cell to

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:06.875
zero only in cases where all of the cells match.

00:02:06.875 --> 00:02:10.490
Otherwise, we'll set it to 255 and make it white.

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:13.500
For example, at this point,

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:15.820
not all of the cells match.

00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:19.610
So we'll set the target cell to 255.

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:25.780
Then we'll just repeat that across the entire image,

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:28.060
and our erosion process that

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:30.190
removed a layer of cells at the edges.

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:32.020
We've also lost the rounded edges.

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:34.750
One of the effect of erosion is to remove fine detail.

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:38.410
Now, let's consider what's happened to our image so far.

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:40.240
We started with this image of

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:43.265
a black solid cross inside a black square.

00:02:43.265 --> 00:02:45.394
Then we apply dilation,

00:02:45.394 --> 00:02:46.900
which had the effect of extending

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:49.195
the edge pixels and filling-in the gaps.

00:02:49.195 --> 00:02:51.310
Finally, we applied erosion,

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:53.310
which remove the edge pixels again,

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:57.100
so we ended up with the original square with the gaps filled-in.

00:02:57.100 --> 00:02:59.629
The net effect of applying dilation

00:02:59.629 --> 00:03:03.150
followed by erosion is called closing.

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:06.770
Now, the opposite of closing is opening,

00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:08.630
and we could do that by performing

00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:11.275
the same operations in the opposite order.

00:03:11.275 --> 00:03:14.205
So we could start with the same image

00:03:14.205 --> 00:03:16.940
and then this time apply erosion,

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:18.560
which removes the pixels around

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:20.980
the edge and loses some of the detail.

00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:23.565
Then we apply dilation,

00:03:23.565 --> 00:03:26.620
which adds pixels to the edges.
