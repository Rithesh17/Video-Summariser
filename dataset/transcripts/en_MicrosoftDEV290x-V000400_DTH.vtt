00:00:01.460 --> 00:00:04.110
>> Now when you're working with images,

00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:07.470
there's a number of operations you can perform to manipulate them.

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:09.930
Some of these might seem a little trivial at first,

00:00:09.930 --> 00:00:12.060
but they can be important when it comes to preparing

00:00:12.060 --> 00:00:15.225
image data to train a machine learning model for computer vision.

00:00:15.225 --> 00:00:18.285
So let's take a look at a few basic operations.

00:00:18.285 --> 00:00:20.610
Here's a common situation,

00:00:20.610 --> 00:00:23.100
suppose you've taken a photograph on your phone,

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:25.260
but when you look at the image file that's been created,

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:29.025
it's displayed in portrait orientation instead of landscape.

00:00:29.025 --> 00:00:30.975
In cases like these,

00:00:30.975 --> 00:00:33.150
you need to be able to rotate the image.

00:00:33.150 --> 00:00:34.920
In other words, change the shape of

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:38.320
the pixel array and move the values accordingly.

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:43.610
Similarly, you might want to transpose or flip the image,

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:46.530
so that it's reversed into its mirror image.

00:00:47.050 --> 00:00:51.650
Another really common requirement is to resize the image by

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:53.660
increasing or decreasing the size

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:55.790
of the array containing the pixel values,

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:57.500
and condensing or interpolating

00:00:57.500 --> 00:01:00.510
values to make the image fit the new size.

00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:03.130
Then, when we resize an image,

00:01:03.130 --> 00:01:05.135
it's important to bear in mind that the image is

00:01:05.135 --> 00:01:08.510
scaled in proportion to its original dimensions.

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:10.520
Resizing an imagery to

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:14.510
a different aspect ratio results in some distortion to the image,

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:17.540
producing a squashing or a stretching effect.

00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:22.990
So how can we resize and reshape an image without distorting it?

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:25.550
Well, one commonly used technique is

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:27.530
to resize the image proportionally,

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:30.635
so that its longest dimension meets the required size.

00:01:30.635 --> 00:01:32.390
Then, overlay it onto

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:34.745
a new background image of the right dimensions,

00:01:34.745 --> 00:01:37.385
which will add some padding to the shorter edge.

00:01:37.385 --> 00:01:40.055
It's like mounting a rectangular photograph

00:01:40.055 --> 00:01:42.360
in a square picture frame.
