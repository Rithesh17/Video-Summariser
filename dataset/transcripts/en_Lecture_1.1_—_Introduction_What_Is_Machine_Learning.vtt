00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:04.259
what this machine learning in this video

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:06.210
we will try to define what it is and

00:00:04.259 --> 00:00:07.649
also try to give you a sense of when you

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:09.599
want to use machine learning

00:00:07.649 --> 00:00:11.610
even among machine learning

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:13.830
practitioners there isn't a well

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:15.900
accepted definition of what is and what

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:17.880
isn't machine learning but let me show

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:19.580
you a couple of examples of the ways

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:22.020
that people have tried to define it

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:25.109
here's the definition of what is machine

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:27.390
learning that is due to author Samuel he

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:29.010
defined machine learning as the field of

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:30.779
study that gives computers the ability

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:34.079
to learn without being explicitly

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:36.719
programmed Samuels claim to fame was

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:39.660
that back in the 1950s he wrote a

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:40.860
checkers playing program and the amazing

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:43.590
thing about this checkers playing

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:45.989
program was that Officer Samuel himself

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:47.730
wasn't a very good checkers player but

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:49.350
what he did was he had the program play

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:51.570
tens of thousands of games against

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:53.370
itself and by watching what sorts of

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:55.649
board positions tended to lead to wins

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:57.780
and what sort of board positions tended

00:00:55.649 --> 00:01:00.300
to veto losses the checkers playing

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:02.100
program learned over time what are good

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:04.290
board positions and what a bad board

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:06.210
positions and eventually learned to play

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:08.490
checkers better than Arthur Samuel

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:11.310
himself was able to this was a

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:12.750
remarkable result also Samuel himself

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:15.540
turned out not to be a very good

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:17.430
checkers player but because the computer

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:19.560
has the patience to play tens of

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:21.390
thousands of games against itself no

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:24.270
human has the patience to play that many

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:26.460
games by doing this the computer was

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:28.829
able to get so much checkers playing

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:30.930
experience that it eventually became a

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:34.079
better checkers player than offered

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:36.450
Samuel himself this is somewhat informal

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:38.340
definition and an older one here's a

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:40.049
slightly more recent definition by Tom

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:43.170
Mitchell who is a friend out in

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:45.780
committee Mellon so Tom defines machine

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:47.549
learning by saying that a well-posed

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:50.820
learning problem is defined as follows

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:52.799
he says a computer program is said to

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:54.689
learn from experience II with respect to

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:57.000
some Tosti and some performance measure

00:01:54.689 --> 00:01:58.009
key evidence performance on T as

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.719
measured by P

00:01:58.009 --> 00:02:02.399
improves of experience II I actually

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:03.850
think he came up with this definition

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:06.649
just to make it wrong

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:09.080
for the checkers playing examples the

00:02:06.649 --> 00:02:10.759
experience II would be the experience of

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:13.099
having the program play tens of

00:02:10.759 --> 00:02:15.590
thousands of games against itself the

00:02:13.099 --> 00:02:17.780
task T would be the task of playing

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:20.510
checkers and the performance measure P

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:22.459
would be the probability that wins the

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:25.459
next game of checkers against some new

00:02:22.459 --> 00:02:27.349
opponent throughout these videos besides

00:02:25.459 --> 00:02:29.720
me trying to teach you stuff I'll

00:02:27.349 --> 00:02:31.970
occasionally ask you a question to make

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:35.120
sure you understand the content here's

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:38.299
one on top of the definition of machine

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:40.790
learning by Tom McCullar let's say your

00:02:38.299 --> 00:02:43.700
email program watches which emails you

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:45.260
do or do not value spam so in an email

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:47.870
client like this you might click this

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:51.230
spam button to report some email as spam

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:53.630
but not other emails and based on which

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:57.019
emails you Marcus them say your email

00:02:53.630 --> 00:03:00.350
program learns better how to filter a

00:02:57.019 --> 00:03:02.959
spam email what is the task of T in the

00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:05.360
setting in a few seconds the video will

00:03:02.959 --> 00:03:07.670
pause and when it does so you can use

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:10.190
your mouse to select one of these four

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:11.989
radio buttons to let to let me know

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:16.190
which of these four you think is the

00:03:11.989 --> 00:03:17.989
right answer to this question so

00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:18.440
hopefully you got that this is the right

00:03:17.989 --> 00:03:21.470
answer

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:24.049
classifying emails is a toss T in fact

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:26.930
this definition defines the task T a

00:03:24.049 --> 00:03:30.890
performance measure P and the some

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:33.530
experience e and so watching you label

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:37.400
emails as spam or non-spam this would be

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:40.010
the experience e and the fraction of

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:43.790
emails correctly classified that might

00:03:40.010 --> 00:03:46.970
be our performance measure P and so our

00:03:43.790 --> 00:03:50.120
task performance on the task about

00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:52.579
systems performance on the task T on the

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:55.970
performance measure P will improve after

00:03:52.579 --> 00:03:57.260
the experience e in this course I hope

00:03:55.970 --> 00:03:59.660
to teach you about various different

00:03:57.260 --> 00:04:00.620
types of learning algorithms there are

00:03:59.660 --> 00:04:03.230
several different types of learning

00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:04.900
algorithms the main two types are what

00:04:03.230 --> 00:04:07.790
we call supervised learning and

00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:09.829
unsupervised learning I'll define what

00:04:07.790 --> 00:04:11.930
these terms mean more in the next couple

00:04:09.829 --> 00:04:14.810
videos but it turns out that in

00:04:11.930 --> 00:04:15.860
supervised learning the idea is we're

00:04:14.810 --> 00:04:17.989
going to teach the

00:04:15.860 --> 00:04:20.299
how to do something whereas in

00:04:17.989 --> 00:04:22.910
unsupervised learning we're going to let

00:04:20.299 --> 00:04:25.190
it learn by itself don't worry if these

00:04:22.910 --> 00:04:27.110
two terms don't make sense yet in the

00:04:25.190 --> 00:04:30.110
next two videos I'm going to say exactly

00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:31.970
what these two types of learning on you

00:04:30.110 --> 00:04:34.060
will also hear all the buzz terms such

00:04:31.970 --> 00:04:37.100
as reinforcement learning and

00:04:34.060 --> 00:04:38.480
recommender systems these are other

00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:40.850
types of machine learning algorithms

00:04:38.480 --> 00:04:42.890
that we'll talk about later but the two

00:04:40.850 --> 00:04:44.870
most used types of learning algorithms

00:04:42.890 --> 00:04:46.730
are probably supervised learning and

00:04:44.870 --> 00:04:48.290
unsupervised learning and I'll define

00:04:46.730 --> 00:04:50.180
them in the next two videos and we'll

00:04:48.290 --> 00:04:53.150
spend most as far as talking about these

00:04:50.180 --> 00:04:54.590
two types of learning algorithms it

00:04:53.150 --> 00:04:56.330
turns out one of the other things we'll

00:04:54.590 --> 00:04:59.180
spend a lot of time on in this class is

00:04:56.330 --> 00:05:01.550
practical advice for applying learning

00:04:59.180 --> 00:05:03.140
algorithms this is something that I feel

00:05:01.550 --> 00:05:04.669
pretty strongly about and exactly

00:05:03.140 --> 00:05:07.160
something that I don't know of any other

00:05:04.669 --> 00:05:08.720
University teachers teaching about

00:05:07.160 --> 00:05:12.169
learning algorithms it's like giving you

00:05:08.720 --> 00:05:14.060
a set of tools and equally important or

00:05:12.169 --> 00:05:16.220
more important than giving you the tools

00:05:14.060 --> 00:05:18.890
is to teach you how to apply these tools

00:05:16.220 --> 00:05:21.740
I like to make an analogy to learning to

00:05:18.890 --> 00:05:23.150
become a carpenter imagine that someone

00:05:21.740 --> 00:05:25.910
is teaching you how to be a carpenter

00:05:23.150 --> 00:05:28.490
and they say here's a hammer here's a

00:05:25.910 --> 00:05:31.310
drive screwdriver is a saw good luck

00:05:28.490 --> 00:05:32.930
well that's no good right you have all

00:05:31.310 --> 00:05:34.880
these tools but the more important thing

00:05:32.930 --> 00:05:37.610
is to learn how to use these tools

00:05:34.880 --> 00:05:39.590
properly there's a huge difference we

00:05:37.610 --> 00:05:41.240
can keep between people that know how to

00:05:39.590 --> 00:05:43.340
use these machine learning algorithms

00:05:41.240 --> 00:05:45.470
versus people that don't know how to use

00:05:43.340 --> 00:05:48.110
these tools well here in Silicon Valley

00:05:45.470 --> 00:05:50.330
when I live when I go visit different

00:05:48.110 --> 00:05:53.090
companies even at the top Silicon Valley

00:05:50.330 --> 00:05:54.710
companies very often I see people trying

00:05:53.090 --> 00:05:56.990
to apply machine learning algorithms to

00:05:54.710 --> 00:05:58.490
some problem and sometimes there have

00:05:56.990 --> 00:06:00.110
been going at it for six months

00:05:58.490 --> 00:06:02.000
but sometimes when I look at what

00:06:00.110 --> 00:06:03.500
they're doing I say you know I could

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:05.990
have told them like gee I could have

00:06:03.500 --> 00:06:07.400
told you six months ago or that you

00:06:05.990 --> 00:06:10.220
should be taking a learning algorithm

00:06:07.400 --> 00:06:13.370
and applying it in like the slightly

00:06:10.220 --> 00:06:16.760
modified way and your chance of success

00:06:13.370 --> 00:06:17.600
would have been much higher um so what

00:06:16.760 --> 00:06:19.190
we're going to do in this class is

00:06:17.600 --> 00:06:21.350
actually spend a lot of time talking

00:06:19.190 --> 00:06:22.889
about how if you're actually trying to

00:06:21.350 --> 00:06:25.680
develop a machine learning system

00:06:22.889 --> 00:06:27.780
how to make those best practices types

00:06:25.680 --> 00:06:29.520
decisions about the way in which you

00:06:27.780 --> 00:06:31.620
build your system so that when you apply

00:06:29.520 --> 00:06:33.120
learning algorithm you're less likely to

00:06:31.620 --> 00:06:35.310
end up one of those people who end up

00:06:33.120 --> 00:06:37.169
pursuing somehow for six months that you

00:06:35.310 --> 00:06:39.000
know someone else could have figured out

00:06:37.169 --> 00:06:41.759
just wasn't gonna work at all and it's a

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:43.199
waste of time for six months so I'm

00:06:41.759 --> 00:06:45.719
actually spend a lot of time teaching

00:06:43.199 --> 00:06:47.550
you those sorts of best practices in

00:06:45.719 --> 00:06:49.379
machine learning and AI and how to get

00:06:47.550 --> 00:06:51.539
the stuff to work and how we do it or

00:06:49.379 --> 00:06:53.729
how the best people do it in Silicon

00:06:51.539 --> 00:06:55.229
Valley and around the world I hope to

00:06:53.729 --> 00:06:57.449
make you one of the best people and

00:06:55.229 --> 00:06:59.310
knowing how to design and build serious

00:06:57.449 --> 00:07:02.250
machine learning and AI systems

00:06:59.310 --> 00:07:04.560
so that's machine learning and these are

00:07:02.250 --> 00:07:06.960
the main topics I hope to teach in the

00:07:04.560 --> 00:07:08.969
next video I'm going to define what is

00:07:06.960 --> 00:07:11.340
supervised learning and after that what

00:07:08.969 --> 00:07:13.409
is unsupervised learning and also start

00:07:11.340 --> 00:07:15.529
to talk about when you will use each of

00:07:13.409 --> 00:07:15.529
them
