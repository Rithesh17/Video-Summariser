00:00:05.360 --> 00:00:08.920
You’ve probably heard about a Scientific
Revolution in Europe, lasting from roughly

00:00:08.920 --> 00:00:11.120
the mid-1500s to 1700.

00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:15.200
And we have some very good stories to tell
from this period.

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:20.340
But first, let’s talk historiography, or
how historians have told history differently

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:21.340
over time.

00:00:21.340 --> 00:00:25.410
The trope of the Scientific Revolution is
a useful tool for organizing events in our

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:26.410
story.

00:00:26.410 --> 00:00:28.540
But it also obscures other possible framings.

00:00:28.540 --> 00:00:33.570
In fact—as we pointed out in episode one—the
term “science” wasn’t used in its contemporary

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:36.020
sense until the mid-1800s!

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:39.500
So did a “Scientific Revolution” take
place at all?

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:48.560
[INTRO MUSIC PLAYS]

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:52.800
Philosopher, historian, and trained physicist
Thomas Kuhn had a lot of thoughts on what

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:54.920
makes a revolution in science.

00:00:54.920 --> 00:01:00.540
He wrote a book called The Structure of Scientific
Revolutions, published in 1962.

00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:05.220
And in it, Kuhn argued that different sciences
undergo “revolutions” when scientists

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:11.330
gather enough data that they can’t explain
using their current paradigm, or unstated,

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:14.440
world-organizing theory about how the universe
works.

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:18.210
Kuhn’s ideas have animated a lot of debates
in the history and philosophy of science,

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:19.830
so let’s make sure we’re clear about them.

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:25.290
Normal science is the kind of knowledge that
professional scientists—or natural philosophers—make

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:26.290
most of the time.

00:01:26.290 --> 00:01:31.200
They have a combined research program and
philosophy about what counts as valid knowledge

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:33.030
called a paradigm.

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:35.020
Anomalies are things that the paradigm can’t
explain.

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:38.260
Too many anomalies and… we have a scientific
revolution!

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:40.710
Galileo and Newton overturn Aristotle!

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:42.480
Einstein overturns Newton!

00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:47.140
Or, jumping back to the mid-1500s, Copernicus
overturns Ptolemy!

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:50.201
Historians of science often associate the
start of the Scientific Revolution with a

00:01:50.201 --> 00:01:54.640
Polish politician and all-around smarty-pants
named Nicolaus Copernicus.

00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:57.380
(Nick—keep waiting in the green room until
we need you!)

00:01:57.380 --> 00:02:01.420
But we could just as easily begin with another
Nick—Nicole Oresme.

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:05.680
Oresme argued for heliocentrism, or the theory
that the earth might revolve around the sun,

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:08.259
one hundred and sixty six years before Copernicus!

00:02:08.259 --> 00:02:11.150
Oresme was born around 1320 in Normandy, France.

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:15.420
He attended the College of Navarre, rather
than the prestigious University of Paris,

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:17.279
so he probably came from a humble background.

00:02:17.279 --> 00:02:21.560
But he was very intelligent, becoming grand
master of the College of Navarre and then

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:22.700
a bishop.

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:27.909
Oresme spent a lot of time trying to answer
one of our big questions: “where are we?”

00:02:27.909 --> 00:02:31.850
He went about this rationally, for example,
lining up arguments for or against an earth

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:38.730
that rotates on its axis in his book Livre
du ciel et du monde, or The Book of Heaven

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:40.680
and the World, in 1377.

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:45.230
He noted that it made more sense for the earth
to move than for all of the heavens to move

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:46.329
around the earth.

00:02:46.329 --> 00:02:51.169
Nevertheless, Oresme concluded that the bible
dictates that the earth must remain still

00:02:51.169 --> 00:02:53.209
and chill.

00:02:53.209 --> 00:02:54.209
So close!

00:02:54.209 --> 00:02:58.829
Oresme also criticized astrology as a predictive
science, noting that the lengths of days don’t

00:02:58.829 --> 00:03:04.200
line up perfectly with years, making the recurrence
of certain astronomical phenomena very rare.

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:08.569
My dude even noted that farmers and sailors
are better at predicting the weather than

00:03:08.569 --> 00:03:09.569
astrologers!

00:03:09.569 --> 00:03:11.840
And Oresme contributed a lot to math and physics.

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:16.279
He pioneered the use of mathematical graphs
to describe how objects move through space

00:03:16.279 --> 00:03:17.310
over time.

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:22.290
And he scooped Galileo on the physics of falling
objects, again by well over a century!

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:27.299
Oresme’s theories could have helped jump-start
a revolution in the physical sciences… but

00:03:27.299 --> 00:03:28.299
they didn’t.

00:03:28.299 --> 00:03:29.299
Why?

00:03:29.299 --> 00:03:32.299
Maybe because he didn’t really push them,
and his contemporaries didn’t see them as

00:03:32.299 --> 00:03:33.749
particularly important.

00:03:33.749 --> 00:03:39.699
A little over a century later, another polymath
named Copernicus worked on some similar problems

00:03:39.699 --> 00:03:41.340
with more radical results.

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:42.739
Historiography strikes!

00:03:42.739 --> 00:03:48.579
There is so much cool history out there, historians
have to make hard choices about when to “start”

00:03:48.579 --> 00:03:52.069
a big idea and whose name to pin to it.

00:03:52.069 --> 00:03:53.560
Okay, Nick—now we’re ready for you!

00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:59.269
Nicolaus Copernicus was born in 1473 in what
is now Poland to a family of well-off merchants.

00:03:59.269 --> 00:04:04.029
We don’t have a ton of documents by Copernicus,
up until his major work on astronomy.

00:04:04.029 --> 00:04:07.569
But we know that he went to school around
1500 to be a humanist.

00:04:07.569 --> 00:04:13.200
Copernicus probably spoke Latin, German, Polish,
Greek, and Italian, and he translated Greek

00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:14.200
poetry.

00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:18.190
He studied arts, math, and astronomy at the
University of Kraków.

00:04:18.190 --> 00:04:21.090
And he visited the Universities of Bologna
and Padua.

00:04:21.090 --> 00:04:23.920
Along with the liberal arts, Copernicus also
studied medicine.

00:04:23.920 --> 00:04:28.710
He would later work mostly as a sort of private
physician-slash-economist for the high-ups

00:04:28.710 --> 00:04:29.720
back in Poland.

00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:33.950
But the reason that we’re talking about
this Nick is that he took up astronomy.

00:04:33.950 --> 00:04:39.060
He decided that retrograde motion—planets
seemingly traveling around in loopty-loops!—was

00:04:39.060 --> 00:04:44.010
an “astronomical monster,” an obvious
impossibility.

00:04:44.010 --> 00:04:48.890
Copernicus also repudiated Ptolemy’s “equant
point”—an imaginary mathematical point

00:04:48.890 --> 00:04:52.360
that helped earlier astronomers see planets
move at uniform speeds.

00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:56.680
Ultimately, Copernicus proposed a heliocentric
universe of the cosmos: in this model, the

00:04:56.680 --> 00:05:01.350
earth rotates on its axis once every twenty-four
hours, and the Earth revolves around the sun

00:05:01.350 --> 00:05:02.450
once every year.

00:05:02.450 --> 00:05:07.870
Copernicus first wrote about heliocentrism
in his Commentariolus, or mini-commentary,

00:05:07.870 --> 00:05:09.140
in 1514.

00:05:09.140 --> 00:05:16.690
He was afraid that many people—being devout
Aristotelians, Ptolemy-ians, and Christians—would

00:05:16.690 --> 00:05:18.730
ridicule his life’s work.

00:05:18.730 --> 00:05:23.590
Most people thought heliocentrism was wrong,
and many found the idea downright blasphemous.

00:05:23.590 --> 00:05:28.590
So for years, the only source of Copernicus’s
radical new theory was the outline that his

00:05:28.590 --> 00:05:34.300
protege Rheticus published in 1540, called
Narratio prima, or The First Account.

00:05:34.300 --> 00:05:38.590
When he was facing the end of his life, however,
Copernicus relented.

00:05:38.590 --> 00:05:45.500
On his deathbed in 1543, he received the first
copy of his book, which I'm going to attempt to pronounce now...

00:05:45.500 --> 00:05:48.980
De revolutionibus orbium

00:05:48.980 --> 00:05:54.420
cœlestium, or what all the cool cats call
“De rev”—On the Revolutions of the Heavenly

00:05:54.420 --> 00:05:55.420
Spheres.

00:05:55.420 --> 00:06:00.460
According to legend, Copernicus woke up from
a coma, took one look at the published De

00:06:00.460 --> 00:06:05.110
rev, smiled—and died peacefully, knowing
that his great work would finally reach a

00:06:05.110 --> 00:06:06.320
wider audience.

00:06:06.320 --> 00:06:09.840
And also that he couldn’t get persecuted
for it cause he was super dead!

00:06:09.840 --> 00:06:13.250
As happens often in the history of science,
Copernicus’s contribution wasn’t really

00:06:13.250 --> 00:06:19.100
coming up with a new idea, but taking a non-mainstream
idea and explaining it in a way that made

00:06:19.100 --> 00:06:20.750
people paid attention.

00:06:20.750 --> 00:06:25.100
In proposing a sun-centered cosmos, Copernicus
was working on a theory that had never really

00:06:25.100 --> 00:06:28.750
caught on in Europe but had also never really
gone away.

00:06:28.750 --> 00:06:33.160
Besides his fellow-Nick, Oresme, Copernicus
knew about the heliocentric model espoused

00:06:33.160 --> 00:06:39.390
by the ancient Greek astronomer, Aristarchus
of Samos, who was born around 310 BCE, about

00:06:39.390 --> 00:06:41.610
a decade after Aristotle died.

00:06:41.610 --> 00:06:45.640
Aristarchus was waaay ahead of his his time:
he put the sun in the center of the solar

00:06:45.640 --> 00:06:48.620
system, and then put the planets in their
correct order around it.

00:06:48.620 --> 00:06:51.980
He guessed that other stars were like the
sun, just farther away.

00:06:51.980 --> 00:06:54.990
He even deduced that the earth rotates on
its axis.

00:06:54.990 --> 00:06:57.889
But most astronomers rejected Aristarchus’s
ideas… until Copernicus.

00:06:57.889 --> 00:07:03.250
If there’s any guy in history that told
us where we were the best, it was that greek

00:07:03.250 --> 00:07:04.740
dude that everyone forgot about.

00:07:04.740 --> 00:07:06.740
But people paid attention to Copernicus.

00:07:06.740 --> 00:07:12.430
ThoughtBubble, shine some light on why his
book about revolutions was revolutionary:

00:07:12.430 --> 00:07:17.450
De rev was not based on new observations,
and it did not prove heliocentrism.

00:07:17.450 --> 00:07:22.389
In it, Copernicus hypothesized that his theory
must be a better-fit model for the cosmos

00:07:22.389 --> 00:07:27.981
than the geocentrism of Ptolemy, because a
sun-centered model was more “pleasing to

00:07:27.981 --> 00:07:28.981
the mind.”

00:07:28.981 --> 00:07:31.730
And Copernicus’s theory was so pleasing!

00:07:31.730 --> 00:07:34.980
In his heliocentric model, retrograde motion
disappeared.

00:07:34.980 --> 00:07:37.870
Copernicus dictated a definite order of the
planets:

00:07:37.870 --> 00:07:41.150
Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, and
then Saturn.

00:07:41.150 --> 00:07:44.830
Copernicus’s theory also made the universe
twenty times wider across than Ptolemy.

00:07:44.830 --> 00:07:51.680
Which turned out not to be big enough, turns out the universe is very big—but
still so big that most people didn’t believe it.

00:07:51.680 --> 00:07:56.300
But Copernicus didn’t revolutionize everything
about the Christian–Aristotelian cosmos.

00:07:56.310 --> 00:07:59.270
For one, Copernicus’s math was a disaster.

00:07:59.270 --> 00:08:04.530
And, in his theory, the Earth and other planets
revolved around a center point that was near

00:08:04.530 --> 00:08:07.460
the sun, but wasn’t exactly the sun.

00:08:07.460 --> 00:08:11.270
And the planets were still embedded in crystalline
spheres.

00:08:11.270 --> 00:08:16.040
For Copernicus, the idea that the earth rotates
on its axis was the “third motion.”

00:08:16.040 --> 00:08:20.889
That is, along with the rotation of the whole
sphere, defining a year, and a transition

00:08:20.889 --> 00:08:23.560
from day to night, defining a day.

00:08:23.560 --> 00:08:26.360
The third motion explained the other stuff.

00:08:26.360 --> 00:08:30.950
Thanks Thought Bubble, Nick’s grand theory
fit into the first twenty-four pages of his

00:08:30.950 --> 00:08:31.950
book.

00:08:31.950 --> 00:08:35.930
The rest was dense and, frankly, not very
revolutionary astronomy.

00:08:35.930 --> 00:08:40.200
Copernicus used Ptolemy's fifteen-hundred
year old data to build his system.

00:08:40.200 --> 00:08:46.740
So maybe Copernicus wasn’t a revolutionary
within science, just one more in a long line of good astronomers.

00:08:46.740 --> 00:08:51.920
The Scientific Revolution is sometimes positioned
as a break in Europe between a Christian concept

00:08:51.920 --> 00:08:55.279
of knowledge and a secular or worldly one.

00:08:55.279 --> 00:08:58.769
Certainly, Copernicus’s cosmos doesn’t
look like Dante’s.

00:08:58.769 --> 00:09:01.720
But if De rev was a break, it wasn’t very
sharp.

00:09:01.720 --> 00:09:06.600
Copernicus was a diplomat, a religious person,
and generally risk-averse.

00:09:06.600 --> 00:09:10.180
He was a canon in the church—a position
just below bishop.

00:09:10.180 --> 00:09:13.100
He dedicated De rev to Pope Paul III.

00:09:13.100 --> 00:09:16.180
Protestant leader Martin Luther did reject
heliocentrism.

00:09:16.180 --> 00:09:20.149
But this didn’t become a public controversy
until Galileo’s time, a hundred years later.

00:09:20.149 --> 00:09:25.569
In fact, Copernicus’s publisher, Andreas
Osiander, added an anonymous preface to De rev,

00:09:25.569 --> 00:09:29.149
saying that the book was only
a thought experiment:

00:09:29.149 --> 00:09:33.389
it didn’t need to be true to help astronomers
better understand the math behind the motions

00:09:33.389 --> 00:09:36.649
of the planets, and thus make better predictions
about them.

00:09:36.649 --> 00:09:38.699
It didn’t even need to be probable.

00:09:38.699 --> 00:09:43.800
This was… not exactly a battle
cry challenging conventional cosmology.

00:09:43.800 --> 00:09:48.450
Regardless—according to a common version
of the history of science—this is how the

00:09:48.450 --> 00:09:50.180
Scientific Revolution started.

00:09:50.180 --> 00:09:51.649
Was it a revolution?

00:09:51.649 --> 00:09:55.870
The majority of people on earth didn’t know
the Scientific Revolution was starting when

00:09:55.870 --> 00:09:56.870
De rev appeared.

00:09:56.870 --> 00:10:01.689
They didn’t see any armies forcing them
at gunpoint to think about the fact that—plot

00:10:01.689 --> 00:10:03.399
twist—the earth revolves around the sun.

00:10:03.399 --> 00:10:07.839
The “battles” about this, when they occurred
at all, took place in the halls of universities

00:10:07.839 --> 00:10:11.519
or between the covers of books that most people
couldn’t even read!

00:10:11.519 --> 00:10:16.360
It’s true that, by 1700, European thinkers
had pretty much moved away from the science

00:10:16.360 --> 00:10:19.259
of Aristotle and Ptolemy, or at least many
parts of it.

00:10:19.259 --> 00:10:23.620
But the concept of the Scientific Revolution
comes from the nineteenth century.

00:10:23.620 --> 00:10:25.709
Historians looked back and said:

00:10:25.709 --> 00:10:28.649
“How Europeans answered big questions such
as ‘where are we?’

00:10:28.649 --> 00:10:31.740
really started to change around the middle
of the 1500s.

00:10:31.740 --> 00:10:36.449
By the middle of the 1600s, natural philosophers
had developed new methods of making all kinds

00:10:36.449 --> 00:10:37.449
of knowledge.

00:10:37.449 --> 00:10:40.410
We dub this shift, ‘the Scientific Revolution!’”

00:10:40.410 --> 00:10:44.910
This idea of a break makes sense when you
remember the motto of the Royal Society, “nullius

00:10:44.910 --> 00:10:49.660
in verba”—don’t believe something just
because Aristotle said it!

00:10:49.660 --> 00:10:54.040
Natural philosopher such as Francis Bacon
and Robert Boyle pushed for experiments and

00:10:54.040 --> 00:10:56.180
published their results in journals.

00:10:56.180 --> 00:10:59.480
And more people had access to books like De
rev, thanks to Gutenberg.

00:10:59.480 --> 00:11:03.990
So you can call it either way: a revolution
didn’t take place, because the number of people

00:11:03.990 --> 00:11:08.579
involved at the time was small, and not much
changed in daily life due to new ideas in

00:11:08.579 --> 00:11:09.579
science.

00:11:09.579 --> 00:11:13.889
Or a revolution did take place, because Galileo
got in trouble for looking at Jupiter, Newton

00:11:13.889 --> 00:11:18.790
invented calculus, and French and English
natural philosophers could argue via journal.

00:11:18.790 --> 00:11:20.730
We’re gonna talk about all these stories soon!

00:11:20.730 --> 00:11:24.120
In conclusion: people named Nick make the
best astronomers.

00:11:24.120 --> 00:11:28.790
Two of them helped catch medieval Europe up
to the astronomical knowledge level of India,

00:11:28.790 --> 00:11:29.819
or classical Mesoamerica.

00:11:29.819 --> 00:11:33.930
(Remember how the Maya were really, really
into astronomy, centuries ago?)

00:11:33.930 --> 00:11:38.509
So the idea of “the” Scientific Revolution,
in early modern Europe, doesn’t make as

00:11:38.509 --> 00:11:44.149
much sense as the idea of many scientific
revolutions in different places at different

00:11:44.149 --> 00:11:45.149
times.

00:11:45.149 --> 00:11:49.970
And finally—and this is so critical!—just
as science is an active area of research today,

00:11:49.970 --> 00:11:51.630
history is too.

00:11:51.630 --> 00:11:56.559
Historians have to choose what stories to
tell and how to most accurately frame them

00:11:56.559 --> 00:11:58.519
for their own times and places.

00:11:58.519 --> 00:12:02.910
Next time—we’ll accompany science-boss
Tycho Brahe on a duel and meet Copernicus’s

00:12:02.910 --> 00:12:05.880
historical brother from another mother, Johannes
Kepler.

00:12:05.880 --> 00:12:12.280
Crash Course History of Science is filmed in the Dr. Cheryl C. Kinney studio in Missoula, MT and it's made with the help of all these nice people.

00:12:12.280 --> 00:12:14.760
And our Animation team is Thought Cafe.

00:12:14.760 --> 00:12:24.040
Crash Course is a Complexly production. If you wanna keep imagining the world complexly with us, you can check out some of our other channels like Sexplanations, How to Adult, and Healthcare Triage.
