00:00:08.520 --> 00:00:11.400
SPEAKER 1: To answer your question, the Internet of Things

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:16.080
is when we connect up everyday physical things to the internet.

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:18.900
Yes, even things like shoes.

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:22.630
These things can give us information that can be used to improve your life

00:00:22.630 --> 00:00:25.176
or your business or the environment.

00:00:25.176 --> 00:00:27.060
Well, yes.

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:31.770
Your boot can tell us things about you, or it, or the places you've walked,

00:00:31.770 --> 00:00:34.320
and where you are right now.

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:36.480
It's going to be another Industrial Revolution.

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:38.350
You'd better get ready.

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:41.400
Not a bad revolution, but like when computers

00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:43.420
arrived and changed everything.

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:46.560
The Internet of Things means the internet doesn't just

00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:48.810
collect and distribute information.

00:00:48.810 --> 00:00:51.360
It can also feel and intelligently respond.

00:00:53.365 --> 00:00:55.680
What were you looking for?

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:57.905
You can't see the internet of things working.

00:00:57.905 --> 00:00:59.650
Ah, your boot.

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:07.550
You think your boot has connected to the internet and booked itself a holiday.

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:09.880
No, that's not how it works.

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:13.370
Though, if you'd been working too hard, your shoe

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:17.570
could send data to the internet cloud, where it would be analyzed,

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:19.550
and then a message would be sent to your boss

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:22.600
to say that it was time for you to have a holiday.

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:25.780
Yeah, it's pretty good, isn't it?
