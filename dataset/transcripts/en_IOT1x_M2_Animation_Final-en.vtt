[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:06.370 --> 00:00:08.850
SPEAKER 1: The things, in the Internet of Things,

00:00:08.850 --> 00:00:12.231
potentially include everything - living things,

00:00:12.231 --> 00:00:15.165
and very ordinary things, and very big things.

00:00:18.350 --> 00:00:22.820
However, it is actually the sensors in things that collect information,

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:26.870
and it is the actuators that might receive instructions from the internet

00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:28.530
to make the things act...

00:00:28.530 --> 00:00:32.150
hence, the IoT's ability to feel and act.

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:33.100
Confused?

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:35.310
Well, let's look at an example.

00:00:35.310 --> 00:00:37.010
Imagine a sprinkler system.

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:37.880
Think big.

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:39.680
Think outside yourself.

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:44.480
Think of one on a huge farm, where an intelligent watering system can

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:47.120
save water and increase profits.

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:48.890
Yes, that's better.

00:00:48.890 --> 00:00:51.770
So, this smart sprinkler system--

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:52.485
EVERYMAN: Hmm.

00:00:52.485 --> 00:00:56.160
SPEAKER 1: It is smart, yes, if you'll let me go on.

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:59.540
There's a moisture sensor in the soil, and it sends information

00:00:59.540 --> 00:01:04.390
about moisture levels, which is collated together with online weather forecasts.

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:08.030
The system decides if it needs to water, and for how long,

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:10.940
and sends that command to the sprinkler.

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:13.430
The sensor is the moisture detector.

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:16.140
And the actuator is the valve and solenoid

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:18.140
that start and stop water flow.

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:21.590
And they both connect to the internet to control the sprinkler.

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:26.120
So the system is smart; sensing, thinking, and acting,

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:28.900
without any person being involved.
