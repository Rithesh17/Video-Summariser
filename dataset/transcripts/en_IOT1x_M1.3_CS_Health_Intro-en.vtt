SHIVA SHARIF BIDABADI: So I'm Shiva.

00:00:03.940 --> 00:00:08.109
I'm doing post-grad studies in Department of Electrical

00:00:08.109 --> 00:00:10.030
and Computer Engineering of Curtin.

00:00:10.030 --> 00:00:14.980
My project is trying to find a way or a system

00:00:14.980 --> 00:00:19.230
to be used in early identification of abnormalities in the walking gait

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:20.020
patterns.

00:00:20.020 --> 00:00:23.320
Dropping of the forefoot happens due to the different reasons.

00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:28.270
For example, weakness in the muscles or pressure on the nerve.

00:00:28.270 --> 00:00:34.165
This problem, foot drop can cause different problems for old people,

00:00:34.165 --> 00:00:34.665
for example.

00:00:34.665 --> 00:00:37.030
They can be ended up in falling to the ground.

00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:43.480
But in young persons can cause problems such as limitation in the sports

00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:44.770
and those kind of things.

00:00:44.770 --> 00:00:48.820
So what we are trying to do is having a device

00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:51.940
to capture these movements from the patients

00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:54.400
once they come into the clinical area.

00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:57.190
But in future, one of the future steps of the project

00:00:57.190 --> 00:01:01.180
can be having this device get used at home

00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:04.330
during the daily activities of the subjects,

00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:08.150
once they are doing their normal daily movements.

00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:12.400
And this system can be directly connect to the internet

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:15.380
and the data can be captured.

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:19.340
This system is going to be a user-friendly system, which

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:23.580
is low in cost and also portable and lightweight

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:27.040
to be used by the patients or old people.

00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:31.900
So comparing to the previous methods of gait analyzing,

00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:36.840
it's way cheaper and more easy to use.
