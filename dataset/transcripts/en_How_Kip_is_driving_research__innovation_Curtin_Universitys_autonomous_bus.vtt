00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:03.659
>> I think it's a fantastic opportunity

00:00:03.659 --> 00:00:08.610
for Curtin to show the state, the country and

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:11.130
the world that as an early adopter, this is

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:13.100
what a University should be about.

00:00:13.120 --> 00:00:16.520
>> I think the moral and the safety issues of

00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:19.340
driverless vehicles is actually important here.

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:20.460
>> Control is probably the

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:21.689
biggest stumbling block that we're going

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:23.730
to face in terms of human psychology and

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:26.580
increasing the adoption of autonomous vehicles.

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:28.019
>> It's just a question of how

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:30.000
many decisions will we let the vehicle

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:31.800
make for us and I think we will

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:34.290
eventually get to a point of the vehicle

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:36.120
making all the decisions for us.

00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:42.440
>> Having an autonomous vehicle on a

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:45.840
University provides a safe environment

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:48.380
in which we can test this brand-new technology.

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:49.760
>> We're very interested in the

00:00:49.769 --> 00:00:51.300
extent to which autonomous vehicles are

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:53.280
going to change society as a whole but

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:54.659
specifically in terms of the health

00:00:54.659 --> 00:00:57.089
outcomes and they are vast and probably

00:00:57.089 --> 00:00:59.700
completely underestimated at this point in time.

00:00:59.700 --> 00:01:00.780
>> I'm really interested in

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:03.000
people's responses to the bus and to

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:04.949
the technology, answering questions like

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:07.830
will they perceive it as a danger to

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:09.539
public safety or do they think that it's

00:01:09.539 --> 00:01:11.610
perfectly safe? How do they respond to

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:13.679
the idea of a vehicle with clearly no

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:15.440
driver here in this vehicle?

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:18.140
>> I like the idea of The Internet of Things

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:20.280
driving this because the bus can be a

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:22.590
thing on the internet where users can

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:25.500
interact in the way that potentially

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:28.440
creates new business environment.

00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:30.929
>> I see the benefits on both sides, we get to work

00:01:30.929 --> 00:01:32.819
with the University and understand how

00:01:32.819 --> 00:01:35.100
we can solve some challenging problems

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:36.690
that we can see within our important

00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:38.610
customers, but at the same time the

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:40.590
University can actually leverage a lot of

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:42.659
the solutions that we're working with

00:01:42.660 --> 00:01:45.560
in a sort of a rapid prototype approach.

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:47.420
>> Having this kind of technology available

00:01:47.429 --> 00:01:50.190
on Curtin campus enables us to watch

00:01:50.190 --> 00:01:52.540
humans interacting with the technology,

00:01:52.540 --> 00:01:53.759
so how do they feel about the technology

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:55.950
prior to exposure, how do they feel about

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:58.040
it afterwards, what are the sticking points,

00:01:58.040 --> 00:01:58.960
what are the things that we need to

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:01.170
educate them about or tell them about to

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:03.090
enable them to be more accepting, longer

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:04.720
term of the technology.

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:07.619
>> The cars, the autonomous cars of the future will be

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:10.590
covered in sensors and they will have

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:12.420
all that information being fed into

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:14.790
effectively a machine learning device

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:17.640
that will make very good decisions.

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:18.810
>> So if you think about the fact that

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:20.190
we've got about 1,200 people a year

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:22.470
dying on Australian roads and another 35

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:23.880
thousand or so who end up in hospital,

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:26.459
that's close to 16 billion dollars

00:02:26.459 --> 00:02:27.690
worth of expenditure just dealing with

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:30.420
that road trauma. The forecasts are that

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:32.459
when we have autonomous vehicles, they're

00:02:32.459 --> 00:02:34.290
going to all but eradicate those costs

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:36.360
because most accidents are the result of

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:38.130
human error and that human error will

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:40.460
be taken out of the equation.

00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:42.140
>> There's a lot more to it than just passenger

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:43.440
vehicles on the road. I think if you

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:45.720
apply the same ideas, autonomous vehicle

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:49.400
technology to trucks, to buses, to trains...

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:51.020
>> and with that will go all the supply

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:52.920
chain optimisation as well, so we'll

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:54.780
become much more efficient as how we

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:56.850
move things around the state.

00:02:56.850 --> 00:02:58.920
>> It's all about the new era of mobility and

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:01.500
transportation, you don't have to buy car insurance

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:02.980
anymore, you don't have to worry about

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:04.280
parking in the big city.

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:05.600
>> The other kinds

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:06.920
of health benefits that we're looking at

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:09.090
are just the fact that people who

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:11.519
become socially isolated due to illness

00:03:11.519 --> 00:03:13.230
or age because they can no longer hold

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:15.660
a license, they'll actually be able to stay mobile.

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:16.820
>> Well for a start I

00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:18.269
think my kids are probably the last

00:03:18.269 --> 00:03:19.560
generation that will need to get a driver's

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:21.180
license, which has always been a bit of a

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:23.280
teenage right of passage but that's gone.

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:25.140
The school run in the morning will

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:26.519
disappear, you'll just whistle for the

00:03:26.519 --> 00:03:28.140
car, it'll pick the kids up and take them

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:30.030
off to school, having to leave work early

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:31.890
for soccer practice, all of that sort of

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:33.840
stuff will disappear. So parents who

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:35.430
feel like a taxi service will probably

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:37.440
appreciate the technology.

00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:40.799
>> Having that bus here gives us a great opportunity to

00:03:40.799 --> 00:03:42.540
develop new solutions and then hopefully

00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:44.730
we can take those solutions and export

00:03:44.730 --> 00:03:45.700
them globally.
