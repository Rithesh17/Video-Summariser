00:00:05.380 --> 00:00:09.640
Let’s recap the history of science so far:
systematic knowledge-making has probably occurred

00:00:09.650 --> 00:00:11.869
as long as humans have been around.

00:00:11.869 --> 00:00:15.730
Unfortunately, historians rely primarily on
written records, and those are only a few

00:00:15.730 --> 00:00:16.900
thousand years old.

00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:21.930
Although ancient Egyptian, Sumerian, and Chinese
cultures had writing and useful sciences,

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:26.430
we started with classical Greek and Indian
cultures that developed systems for understanding

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:28.300
the cosmos and all the stuff in it.

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:32.300
Today, we’re going to jump through space
to see how other cultures made knowledge at

00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:36.730
roughly the same time without any contact
with the peoples of Africa, Asia, or Europe.

00:00:36.730 --> 00:00:40.350
This is a story about the planet Venus, breathtaking
pyramids,

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:43.659
and most of all the question “when are we?”

00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:46.280
What is time, and how do you measure it?

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:56.320
[Intro Music Plays]

00:00:56.320 --> 00:01:01.520
The classical civilizations of Mesoamerica,
or what is now Mexico and Central America,

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:06.550
didn’t “leave behind” as many paper
sources as those of the Indian or Greco-Roman

00:01:06.550 --> 00:01:07.610
linguistic worlds…

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:12.280
Because after CE 1500, Spanish imperialists
destroyed those records.

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:18.440
Of all the Mayan books made of folded-up bark
cloth—called codies—only four survive

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:19.440
today.

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:21.260
Luckily, stone tends to stick around.

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:24.510
There are thousands of Mayan stone engravings.

00:01:24.510 --> 00:01:28.390
Archaeologists are still working to learn
what role monumental stone works served in

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:30.100
ancient Mesoamerican society.

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:34.280
And linguists have only recently decoded many
hieroglyphs found on Mayan engravings.

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:37.890
But stone carvings mostly concern gods and
wars.

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:42.560
Historians struggle to understand what daily
life was like and—in the case of science—how

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:46.370
ancient Mesoamericans produced knowledge unrelated
to the divine stars.

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:51.590
To paraphrase archaeologist Michael Coe, imagine
that everything we knew about English came

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:52.980
from only three prayer books…

00:01:52.980 --> 00:01:55.510
The earliest Mesoamerican writing comes from

00:01:55.510 --> 00:02:01.060
the Olmecs, who lived in what is today southern
Mexico from 1500 to 400 BCE.

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:03.470
Their carvings included human–jaguar hybrids.

00:02:03.470 --> 00:02:09.460
But the Olmecs are best known for their colossal
human heads cut from volcanic stone.

00:02:09.460 --> 00:02:13.030
From an early date, Mesoamerican cultures
traded goods and knowledge.

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:15.790
Over time, sites elsewhere took on Olmec features.

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:21.020
In addition to an art style and a writing
system, the Olmecs invented a mathematics,

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:25.910
including the number zero, and a calendar
system that influenced later Mesoamerican

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:26.910
civilizations.

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:30.420
Ancient Mesoamerican civilization reached
a height of astronomical knowledge under the

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:31.420
Maya.

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:35.780
They ruled over what is now all of Belize
and Guatemala, western El Salvador and Honduras,

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:40.670
and southern Mexico from 2000 BCE until the
1600s, in the common era.

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:43.150
The Maya built great step pyramids.

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:47.569
These were temples devoted to kings as well
as sites for making astronomical observations.

00:02:47.569 --> 00:02:51.540
The Caracol or Observatory of Chichén Itzá,
for example, was built

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:57.420
to align with the extremes of Venus’s rising
and setting in the year CE 1000.

00:02:57.420 --> 00:02:59.160
That's cool!

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:04.380
The Maya had a base-twenty or vigesimal mathematical
system that included zero, but no fractions.

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:07.900
And they created very large tables for calculations.

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:11.561
These tables came in handy because one of
the principal cultural obsessions of the Maya

00:03:11.561 --> 00:03:17.610
priesthood was calculating future calendar
dates—and we’re talking very far future.

00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:21.500
You may have heard a sort of history of science
urban legend—that the Maya thought the world

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:26.380
would end when their calendar calculations
ran out on December 23, 2012…

00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:28.620
Which, I think we can confirm, didn’t happen.

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:32.950
We aren’t sure what the ancient Maya thought,
but it’s true that they made of lot of calculations

00:03:32.950 --> 00:03:35.080
about time for religious purposes.

00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:38.560
To understand Mayan time-keeping, let’s
head to the ThoughtBubble:

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:40.740
“When are we?”

00:03:40.740 --> 00:03:45.330
To answer this question, the Maya used an
extraordinarily complicated system of five

00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:48.250
interlocking calendars of different lengths.

00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:52.910
This provided them with very accurate timing
regarding both the solar and lunar years…

00:03:52.910 --> 00:03:54.340
and the Venusian year.

00:03:54.340 --> 00:03:58.370
Because, to the Maya, Venus was the most important
heavenly body.

00:03:58.370 --> 00:04:03.800
The primary calendars were the tzolkin,
a 260-day sacred cycle that developed by CE

00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:07.050
200, and the “Vague Year” solar calendar.

00:04:07.050 --> 00:04:13.480
The Vague Year has eighteen 20-day months
with a period of five unlucky corrective days

00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:16.320
to bring the year to 365 days total.

00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:17.320
But vaguely.

00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:23.790
The tzolkin and Vague Year together made the
Calendar Round, which repeated every 52 years.

00:04:23.790 --> 00:04:29.630
Also, the 260-day tzolkin was made up of two
smaller calendars, marking a 13-day numbered

00:04:29.630 --> 00:04:35.530
and 20-day named cycle of days.
But also the Maya kept track of the “Long

00:04:35.530 --> 00:04:40.580
Count”—a calendar made of different units
ranging from one day to sixty-three thousand

00:04:40.580 --> 00:04:41.780
years.

00:04:41.780 --> 00:04:46.100
Using the Long Count, the Maya reckoned time
in the millions of years.

00:04:46.100 --> 00:04:51.980
Thus every single day of the Maya year served
a specific sacred function defined in relation

00:04:51.980 --> 00:04:56.530
to Venus, which mattered in Mayan astrology
and medicine; and gave the average person

00:04:56.530 --> 00:05:01.890
a useful sense of time, for example in relation
to the harvest; and also answered the question

00:05:01.890 --> 00:05:03.270
“when are we?”

00:05:03.270 --> 00:05:05.710
accurately across literally millions of years.

00:05:05.710 --> 00:05:11.020
Perhaps no other people in human history have
cultivated such a complete understanding of time.

00:05:11.020 --> 00:05:13.020
And this isn’t just history.

00:05:13.020 --> 00:05:17.770
In Guatemala, there are Mayan priests called
Day Keepers who still keep the sacred calendar.

00:05:17.770 --> 00:05:19.660
And you can buy tzolkins in your local mini-mart.

00:05:19.660 --> 00:05:21.310
Thanks Thought Bubble.

00:05:21.310 --> 00:05:26.590
The Maya developed a writing system of hundreds
of square glyphs depicting natural elements

00:05:26.590 --> 00:05:28.750
such as jaguars, fish, and people.

00:05:28.750 --> 00:05:31.770
These carry both symbolic and phonetic meanings.

00:05:31.770 --> 00:05:35.400
That is, they can indicate sounds and directly
represent ideas.

00:05:35.400 --> 00:05:39.120
The complexity of the system points to a priest–scribe
caste.

00:05:39.120 --> 00:05:41.300
And there was an academy for them at Mayapán.

00:05:41.300 --> 00:05:45.700
From the few Mayan codices that remain, we
know that the scribes determined the lunar

00:05:45.700 --> 00:05:49.110
month to three decimal places and predicted
eclipses.

00:05:49.110 --> 00:05:54.470
They also actively undertook research to improve
the accuracy of their tables, improving their

00:05:54.470 --> 00:05:57.010
understanding of Venus’s movements over
time.

00:05:57.010 --> 00:06:01.050
They may have worked on astronomical tables
for Mars, Mercury, and Jupiter as well.

00:06:01.050 --> 00:06:04.310
Why did the Maya undertake a long-term research
program about the planets?

00:06:04.310 --> 00:06:09.270
We don’t know for sure, but we know they
had a complex astrological system that generated

00:06:09.270 --> 00:06:14.500
prophecies by correlating the positions of
Venus and other heavenly bodies with historical events.

00:06:14.500 --> 00:06:19.860
With this system, the Maya coordinated military
campaigns and how your individual daily life

00:06:19.870 --> 00:06:23.650
would work out… and what would happen millions
of years in the future.

00:06:23.650 --> 00:06:25.080
You know, small stuff.

00:06:25.100 --> 00:06:28.200
How do you build all of those temples to Venus?

00:06:28.210 --> 00:06:29.330
You need a lot of people.

00:06:29.330 --> 00:06:32.850
In pre-industrial times, that meant you needed
good farmers.

00:06:32.850 --> 00:06:38.560
In addition to swidden or shifting agriculture,
the Maya also practiced intensive cultivation

00:06:38.560 --> 00:06:42.050
of crops
such as maize, sunflower, cotton, chiles,

00:06:42.050 --> 00:06:44.139
chocolate, and vanilla using irrigation.

00:06:44.139 --> 00:06:48.740
They domesticated dogs and ducks, and penned
up wild turkeys and deer.

00:06:48.740 --> 00:06:50.720
Is agriculture a science?

00:06:50.720 --> 00:06:55.509
It definitely encompasses lots of knowledge-work,
including crop improvement and the management

00:06:55.509 --> 00:06:58.990
of large-scale production systems involving
canals and multiple harvests.

00:06:58.990 --> 00:07:04.150
In fact, historians are only today coming
to understand just how densely populated the

00:07:04.150 --> 00:07:05.350
Mayan world was.

00:07:05.350 --> 00:07:09.930
Central America is tropical, so many Mayan
ruins lie buried underneath the forest.

00:07:09.930 --> 00:07:14.490
But recent archaeological evidence uncovered
using LiDAR—light detection and ranging—at

00:07:14.490 --> 00:07:19.729
the metropolis of Tikal, in what is now Guatemala,
has shown that Mayan civilization was perhaps

00:07:19.729 --> 00:07:22.550
three times as populous as previously thought.

00:07:22.550 --> 00:07:27.509
By the way, LiDAR a good example of how modern
science can help us understand history, including

00:07:27.509 --> 00:07:28.710
the history of science.

00:07:28.710 --> 00:07:34.039
Without the wheel or the horse, the Maya cities
were for a while united in a true hydraulic

00:07:34.039 --> 00:07:35.039
empire.

00:07:35.039 --> 00:07:38.990
Maya civilization was not only much larger
than, say, the equivalent one in medieval

00:07:38.990 --> 00:07:43.680
England, but on the same scale as the great
dynasties of medieval China.

00:07:43.680 --> 00:07:49.600
Mayan culture came under stress in CE 800,
and the Long Count fell into disuse after 1200.

00:07:49.640 --> 00:07:53.040
The fragility of the Mayan food system probably
played a role in collapse.

00:07:53.050 --> 00:07:57.380
Deforestation to make lime for stucco, or
plaster for decoration, may have played a

00:07:57.380 --> 00:08:00.600
role in changing rainfall patterns, leading
to famines.

00:08:00.600 --> 00:08:05.310
Then, after 1500, Spanish genocide definitively
crushed high Mayan culture.

00:08:05.310 --> 00:08:11.180
The 260-day sacred tzolkin persisted, but
the Maya didn’t maintain a class of astronomer–priests.

00:08:11.200 --> 00:08:15.860
After the decline of the Mayan states but
before the arrival of the Spanish, tribes

00:08:15.860 --> 00:08:19.990
from what is now northern Mexico moved south
and established new kingdoms.

00:08:19.990 --> 00:08:24.900
The largest group of peoples who settled in
central Mexico were the Nahuas.

00:08:24.900 --> 00:08:28.890
The Nahuas called the Aztecs were the great
builders of central Mexico.

00:08:28.890 --> 00:08:34.039
They planned the great capital of Tenochtitlán in 1325, on Lake Texcoco,

00:08:34.039 --> 00:08:39.080
and this city is still around: you might know
it as Ciudad de México, or Mexico City.

00:08:39.080 --> 00:08:43.919
Building a big stone city on top of a lake
and growing enough food for its citizens involved

00:08:43.919 --> 00:08:45.910
a lot of hydraulic engineering.

00:08:45.910 --> 00:08:49.230
The Aztecs created a system of canals, floodgates,
and aqueducts.

00:08:49.230 --> 00:08:52.300
They used dikes to separate fresh and saltwater.

00:08:52.300 --> 00:08:57.170
This allowed them to practice intensive lake-marsh
agriculture, growing maize, amaranth, fish,

00:08:57.170 --> 00:08:58.170
and ducks.

00:08:58.170 --> 00:09:03.980
In this way, Tenochtitlán supported a population
of maybe three hundred thousand.

00:09:03.980 --> 00:09:09.770
Here, the Aztecs supported a full-time priest
caste, as well as a large army and many merchants.

00:09:09.770 --> 00:09:14.020
Aztec bureaucracy included tax collection,
judiciary system, and censuses.

00:09:14.020 --> 00:09:18.820
The Aztecs used the 52-year Mayan Calendar
Round but aligned their great temple with

00:09:18.820 --> 00:09:20.160
the setting sun, not Venus.

00:09:20.160 --> 00:09:25.290
And the Aztecs built other buildings on equinoctial
lines—or the lines along which the plane

00:09:25.290 --> 00:09:30.180
of Earth’s equator passes through the center
of the Sun’s disk, once in the spring and

00:09:30.180 --> 00:09:31.180
once in the fall.

00:09:31.180 --> 00:09:35.300
The Aztecs collected a wealth of botanical
and medical knowledge, maintained by priests

00:09:35.300 --> 00:09:36.630
who also served as astrologers.

00:09:36.630 --> 00:09:42.110
They believed in a complicated humoral system
that linked plants, the human body, and the

00:09:42.110 --> 00:09:43.110
heavens.

00:09:43.110 --> 00:09:48.100
Which was oddly similar to the Greco-Roman-Islamicate
one we’ll talk about in a few episodes.

00:09:48.100 --> 00:09:53.350
Aztec healers seem to have been specialists,
focusing either on surgery, bloodletting,

00:09:53.350 --> 00:09:56.940
childbirth, creating herbal drugs, or treating
sick turkeys.

00:09:56.940 --> 00:10:00.320
Aztec physicians had an extensive anatomical
lexicon.

00:10:00.320 --> 00:10:02.240
They even treated dandruff!

00:10:02.240 --> 00:10:06.610
No wonder Aztec life expectancy exceeded that
of the Spanish colonizers.

00:10:06.610 --> 00:10:10.510
Like the Mesoamericans, the people of South
America traded widely.

00:10:10.510 --> 00:10:15.470
Very widely: a new genetic study of sweet
potatoes shows that Polynesians traveled to

00:10:15.470 --> 00:10:21.519
the Americas around CE 1000 at least once,
traded for these vegetables, and then possibly

00:10:21.519 --> 00:10:22.519
came back.

00:10:22.519 --> 00:10:26.020
They may have also introduced chickens to
the Americas ahead of the Europeans.

00:10:26.020 --> 00:10:31.510
The South Americans forged empires, featuring
monumental stonework and carefully planned

00:10:31.510 --> 00:10:32.510
agriculture.

00:10:32.510 --> 00:10:37.890
The Inka developed an empire in the Andes
Mountains from roughly CE 1100 until the Spanish

00:10:37.890 --> 00:10:38.890
conquest.

00:10:38.890 --> 00:10:42.290
The most famous Inkan site is Machu Pichu,
in what is now Peru.

00:10:42.290 --> 00:10:48.180
This city of polished, carefully fitted stone
was built around 1450… on the top of a mountain.

00:10:48.180 --> 00:10:53.450
The Inkan state involved tax and census records,
standard measures, medical specialists, and

00:10:53.450 --> 00:10:58.140
astronomical and calendric data recorded into
the very architecture of their cities.

00:10:58.140 --> 00:11:04.940
But, unlike the other original empires, no writing system. This makes the story of Incan knowledge making,

00:11:04.940 --> 00:11:05.940
difficult to recover.

00:11:05.950 --> 00:11:11.430
The Inka did, however, use a sophisticated
system of tying strings of knots, called khipu

00:11:11.430 --> 00:11:12.649
to keep records.

00:11:12.649 --> 00:11:17.620
Khipu used a decimal system and allowed the
Inka to share data related to taxes, the census,

00:11:17.620 --> 00:11:20.220
the calendar, and military organization…

00:11:20.220 --> 00:11:24.670
And the khipu might have worked a bit like
a writing system, too, at least some of the

00:11:24.670 --> 00:11:25.670
time.

00:11:25.670 --> 00:11:29.370
Just as linguists are still decoding the hieroglyphs
of the Maya, researchers are still trying

00:11:29.370 --> 00:11:31.350
to understand just what the khipu mean.

00:11:31.350 --> 00:11:36.750
In fact, the latest breakthrough, linking
khipu record-keeping to a colonial-era Spanish

00:11:36.750 --> 00:11:38.269
census, was made by an undergraduate!

00:11:38.269 --> 00:11:43.520
The Spanish and other colonizers devastated cultures native to the Americas.

00:11:43.520 --> 00:11:48.910
Reducing the complexity of thousands of years of history into a small number of paper sources and a

00:11:48.910 --> 00:11:51.950
few dozen monumental stone buildings and artworks.

00:11:51.950 --> 00:11:56.890
Nature reclaimed entire cities, and historians
are left to scratch their heads.

00:11:56.890 --> 00:12:01.459
Many people of Mayan, Aztec, and Inkan heritage
are alive today, but the Spanish genocide

00:12:01.459 --> 00:12:07.390
created a decisive break with ancient Mayan,
Aztec, and Inkan civilizations, distinct from

00:12:07.390 --> 00:12:08.800
those of Europe and elsewhere.

00:12:08.800 --> 00:12:13.290
Next time—we’ll explore the infrastructural
engineering with the ancient Romans.

00:12:13.290 --> 00:12:17.180
Crash Course History of Science is filmed
in the Dr. Cheryl C. Kinney studio in Missoula,

00:12:17.180 --> 00:12:21.370
Montana and it’s made with the help of all
this nice people and our animation team is

00:12:21.370 --> 00:12:22.370
Thought Cafe.

00:12:22.370 --> 00:12:24.050
Crash Course is a Complexly production.

00:12:24.050 --> 00:12:27.970

with us, you can check out some of our other

00:12:27.970 --> 00:12:30.820
