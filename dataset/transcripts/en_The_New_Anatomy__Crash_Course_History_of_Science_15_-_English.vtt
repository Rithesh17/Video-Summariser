00:00:05.299 --> 00:00:10.910
In the 1500s and 1600s, the work of Copernicus
and Galileo, among many others, reshaped how

00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:15.629
natural philosophers in western Europe thought
about the question, where are we?

00:00:15.629 --> 00:00:20.190
But there’s another question to consider
that’s at least equally daunting, what is

00:00:20.190 --> 00:00:21.190
life?

00:00:21.190 --> 00:00:25.269
And to try to answer that question, three
tools stand out as being especially useful:

00:00:25.269 --> 00:00:30.070
...a really long book full of beautifully
grotesque illustrations based on dissected

00:00:30.070 --> 00:00:32.399
bodies…
...experiments about blood pumping through

00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:35.400
living animals…
...and the microscope.

00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:44.420
[Intro Music Plays]

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:47.080
You could call Andreas Vesalius the Copernicus

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:51.550
of anatomy: his name has become synonymous
with a revolution of its own, and his major

00:00:51.550 --> 00:00:55.070
book even came out in 1543, the same year
as De rev.

00:00:55.070 --> 00:00:57.500
Vesalius was born in Brussels in 1514.

00:00:57.500 --> 00:01:01.320
He studied at the Universities of Leuven,
Paris, and Padua.

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:05.700
He wrote his thesis about al-Rāzī, the famous
and prolific medieval physician who wrote

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:07.070
Doubts About Galen.

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:10.200
And Vesalius did some Galen-doubting of his
own.

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:15.320
After conducting years of medical research,
Vesalius wrote up his findings in a gigantic,

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:18.430
seven-volume book with 273 illustrations.

00:01:18.430 --> 00:01:25.900
It was published in 1543 under the name De
Humani corporis fabrica, or On the Fabric

00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:27.440
of the Human Body.

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:32.640
And it redefined the long Hippocratic–Galenic–Arabic–Persian
medical tradition.

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:35.490
It didn’t just tweak Galen’s ideas.

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:39.320
Fabrica was a new way of doing medicine—a
new paradigm.

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:43.140
The seven books of Fabrica cover the bones
and cartilage, the ligaments and muscles,

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:50.360
the veins and arteries, the nerves, the heart, the brain, and “the
organs of nutrition and generation”—meaning

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:51.723
most of the stuff in the body.

00:01:51.723 --> 00:01:56.540
And along the way, it brims with observations
that were new to Vesalius’s world.

00:01:56.540 --> 00:02:01.410
Vesalius accurately described the sternum,
the bones of the arm, the skull, and the entire

00:02:01.410 --> 00:02:02.620
muscular system.

00:02:02.620 --> 00:02:07.480
Importantly, he also wrote that the brain
and nerves are the center of the mind.

00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:12.401
This overturned the Aristotelian idea that
the heart was the center of thought and feeling.

00:02:12.401 --> 00:02:17.010
And, despite possible religious objections,
Vesalius disproved the belief that men had

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:19.390
one rib fewer than women.

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:23.920
He even disproved the idea, from Galen, that
men have more teeth than women.

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:26.200
Seems like fairly easy things to do!

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:28.840
No one had thought to look inside of a woman's mouth.

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:30.840
That's just way too weird!

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:33.540
How are you gonna study a woman??? Where are they?

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:38.420
In fact, Vesalius realized that many of Galen’s
observations, made back in Roman times—when

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:43.760
human dissection was illegal—had actually
been observations of animals, not humans.

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:48.260
Galen incorrectly thought the human lower
jaw was made of two bones, like it is in some animals.

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:51.100
He thought the major blood vessels started
in the liver.

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:54.540
And he thought the human body had a network
of blood vessels at the base of the brain,

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:58.450
called a rete mirable, that are actually found
in dolphins and sheep.

00:02:58.450 --> 00:03:03.110
But Vesalius was able to correct a lot of
this misconceptions, thanks to the big innovation

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:06.760
he used in his lectur-at Padua: dissection.

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:12.400
Instead of hiring a surgeon to do his dirty
work, Vesalius—a scholar—conducted dissections himself.

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:16.900
Thought Bubble, Show us the wonder of hands-on medical observation.

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:20.520
Fabrica is written as a sort of guide to dissecting someone.

00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:25.040
Vesalius clearly explains the order in which
you have to dissect a body to observe each muscle.

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:27.880
He lets you know what tools you need.

00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:32.340
So Fabrica shows how important instruments
are to scientific knowledge-making.

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:36.230
And over the course of its thousands of pages,
you see that Vesalius began to think about

00:03:36.230 --> 00:03:41.910
the human body as a composite of physical,
mechanical, interlocking systems—and not

00:03:41.910 --> 00:03:43.410
a bag of humors.

00:03:43.410 --> 00:03:47.470
In some ways, “anatomy” in the modern
sense begins with Fabrica.

00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:50.450
The book wasn’t just an encyclopedia of
diseases and treatments.

00:03:50.450 --> 00:03:54.720
It was a guide for seeing the body anatomically
instead of humorally.

00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:57.989
And Vesalius wanted others to see what he
saw.

00:03:57.989 --> 00:04:02.730
His book’s illustrations were made possible
by advances in artistic techniques and the

00:04:02.730 --> 00:04:06.840
improvement of detailed woodcut engraving
as ahtechnology.

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:09.980
And Vesalius supervised the whole process
carefully.

00:04:09.980 --> 00:04:14.489
He wrote out such specific instructions for
his printer that the printer included them

00:04:14.489 --> 00:04:15.489
in the text.

00:04:15.489 --> 00:04:21.209
Chances are you’ve seen some of the dissection-inspired
woodcuts from Fabrica: flayed human bodies

00:04:21.209 --> 00:04:27.240
traipse through a stylized Italian countryside,
making dance-like motions, demonstrating how

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:32.810
their muscles and bones connect, and looking…
not too bad for people with no skin.

00:04:32.810 --> 00:04:36.270
Thanks Thought Bubble,
Where Vesalius helped readers of his book

00:04:36.270 --> 00:04:40.979
see the human body differently, they would
still have had many questions about what life

00:04:40.979 --> 00:04:42.689
is and how it functions.

00:04:42.689 --> 00:04:47.240
William Harvey answered one of the big ones—how
does blood work?

00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:49.710
Harvey was born in Kent, England, in 1578.

00:04:49.710 --> 00:04:54.169
He studied in Italy, was a fellow of the Royal
College of Physicians in London, gave popular

00:04:54.169 --> 00:04:58.379
lectures on anatomy, and served as physician
to King James the First.

00:04:58.379 --> 00:05:02.460
He also was a major skeptic when it came to
witchcraft, which was the source of much freaking

00:05:02.460 --> 00:05:03.460
out at the time.

00:05:03.460 --> 00:05:09.770
So, as an official examiner of witches, which
was a thing you could be back then, he acquitted the accused

00:05:09.770 --> 00:05:11.500
rather than having them burned alive.

00:05:11.509 --> 00:05:15.830
But William Harvey is most famous for his
theory of blood circulation, which Galen and

00:05:15.830 --> 00:05:17.849
Vesalius both got wrong.

00:05:17.849 --> 00:05:24.200
Like Vesalius, Harvey learned a lot about
bodies through careful observation, AKA getting gettin' all gross.

00:05:24.200 --> 00:05:29.120
He did this specifically through vivisection,
or cutting open live animals.

00:05:29.129 --> 00:05:34.340
He watched their hearts slow down and finally
stop beating as they died, and he estimated

00:05:34.340 --> 00:05:37.449
the amount of blood that left those exposed
hearts.

00:05:37.449 --> 00:05:41.520
And he used those measurements for a reason:
to help him formulate medicines.

00:05:41.520 --> 00:05:46.520
In doing so, Harvey helped bring the the idea
of rigorous measurement to medical investigation.

00:05:46.520 --> 00:05:52.020
And by 1618, Harvey had arrived at the conclusion
that arterial and venous blood vessels form

00:05:52.020 --> 00:05:56.180
a single, connected, closed circulatory system.

00:05:56.180 --> 00:05:58.270
This was a brand new idea!

00:05:58.270 --> 00:06:02.650
Harvey published his findings in 1628, in
another Latin-language classic which sounds

00:06:02.650 --> 00:06:05.409
a little bit like you’re casting a spell
when you say it:

00:06:05.409 --> 00:06:12.080
Exercitatio Anatomica de Motu Cordis et Sanguinis
in Animalibus, or On the Motion of the Heart

00:06:12.080 --> 00:06:13.080
and Blood.

00:06:13.080 --> 00:06:16.129
Which historians tend to shorten to De Motu
Cordis.

00:06:16.129 --> 00:06:18.550
Which is the name of my new metal band.

00:06:18.550 --> 00:06:23.620
De Motu Cordis was, again, a revolt against
the old Aristotelian–Galenic system.

00:06:23.620 --> 00:06:26.819
It’s also a great early example of comparative
anatomy:

00:06:26.819 --> 00:06:31.219
Harvey compared the hearts and arteries of
many cold-blooded animals in order to understand

00:06:31.219 --> 00:06:36.689
the basics of how a heart pumps blood—or,
really, that heart does pump at all -- as

00:06:36.689 --> 00:06:39.889
opposed to the blood “diffusing” through
the system as Galen thought.

00:06:39.889 --> 00:06:43.889
Through his quantitative experiments, Harvey
disproved the Galenic idea that the liver

00:06:43.889 --> 00:06:46.330
creates the blood found in veins.

00:06:46.330 --> 00:06:51.189
And Harvey figured out that blood flows in
one direction at a time, thanks to valves.

00:06:51.189 --> 00:06:52.689
Also not part of Galen’s system.

00:06:52.689 --> 00:06:57.280
But, while Harvey’s De Motu Cordis was a
more accurate theory of how blood circulates

00:06:57.280 --> 00:07:01.119
than Galen’s, Harvey also fudged his data
in order to make his point.

00:07:01.119 --> 00:07:05.250
When he measured a heart, Harvey estimated
the volume of liquid it could hold, how much

00:07:05.250 --> 00:07:09.490
blood it moved each time it beat, and the
number of beats it made in half an hour.

00:07:09.490 --> 00:07:14.650
And Harvey made each of these estimates intentionally
low, so that people could easily see how wrong

00:07:14.650 --> 00:07:16.869
Galen’s liver-based system was.

00:07:16.869 --> 00:07:21.919
The liver simply couldn’t make enough blood,
fast enough, for the diffusion theory to work.

00:07:21.919 --> 00:07:23.949
But he made sure that the numbers didn’t
come close.

00:07:23.949 --> 00:07:28.639
Now, still, to his credit, Harvey did all
of that observational and experimental work

00:07:28.639 --> 00:07:33.270
without a critical instrument that would soon
be developed over in the Low Countries—the

00:07:33.270 --> 00:07:34.270
microscope.

00:07:34.270 --> 00:07:39.330
Anton Philips van Leeuwenhoek was born in
Delft, in what was then the Dutch Republic,

00:07:39.330 --> 00:07:40.330
in 1632.

00:07:40.330 --> 00:07:44.119
The inventor of the microscope became the
so-called “father” of microbiology, because

00:07:44.119 --> 00:07:48.690
you can’t have a “microbiology” without
a microscope -- another example of the importance

00:07:48.690 --> 00:07:51.229
of instrumentation to scientific knowledge-making.

00:07:51.229 --> 00:07:56.080
We don’t have all the details of what process
Van Leeuwenhoek used to create his invention.

00:07:56.080 --> 00:08:02.039
But we do know he made hundreds of magnifying
lenses and at least twenty-five proper microscopes.

00:08:02.039 --> 00:08:05.330
Somewhere along the line, Van Leeuwenhoek
told a doctor friend about his investigation

00:08:05.330 --> 00:08:09.619
of the very small, and that friend told the
Royal Society over in England.

00:08:09.619 --> 00:08:15.220
In 1673, the Philosophical Transactions of
the Royal Society published van Leeuwenhoek’s

00:08:15.220 --> 00:08:16.220
microscope-enabled observations.

00:08:16.220 --> 00:08:21.039
A few years of debate ensued about whether
van Leeuwenhoek was pulling everyone’s collective

00:08:21.039 --> 00:08:25.330
natural–philosophical chain, but members
of the Royal Society eventually confirmed

00:08:25.330 --> 00:08:26.330
his findings.

00:08:26.330 --> 00:08:32.229
Using his invention, van Leeuwenhoek discovered
an entire world of amazing forms in miniature.

00:08:32.229 --> 00:08:36.830
He found single-celled organisms living their
best lives at an entirely different

00:08:36.830 --> 00:08:38.089
scale than our own.

00:08:38.089 --> 00:08:43.329
He called these “animalcules” or “little
animals‚” many of which aren’t actually

00:08:43.329 --> 00:08:44.329
animals.

00:08:44.329 --> 00:08:47.290
For example, in 1677, van Leeuwenhoek observed
spermatozoa.

00:08:47.290 --> 00:08:50.050
And in 1682, he observed muscle fibers.

00:08:50.050 --> 00:08:54.470
Over the years, he wrote hundreds of letters
to the Royal Society and similar institutions

00:08:54.470 --> 00:08:56.319
to share his observations.

00:08:56.320 --> 00:09:01.100
But he never divulged the secret of his microscope-manufacturing.

00:09:01.100 --> 00:09:01.769
...Jerk!

00:09:01.769 --> 00:09:05.340
Another Dutch natural philosopher combined
the work of van Leeuwenhoek and Vesalius.

00:09:05.340 --> 00:09:10.240
Jan Swammerdam was born in Amsterdam, in the
Dutch Republic, in 1637.

00:09:10.240 --> 00:09:12.230
And, yes, I said that without laughing.

00:09:12.230 --> 00:09:16.860
He delicately dissected animal and plant tissues
under a microscope, learning in the process

00:09:16.860 --> 00:09:20.040
about both the structure and the development
of life.

00:09:20.040 --> 00:09:22.959
This was a critical turn in the life sciences.

00:09:22.959 --> 00:09:28.130
Swammerdam observed, for example, how an insect
changes from an egg into a wriggly larva,

00:09:28.130 --> 00:09:32.959
then a hibernating pupa, and finally an adult,
often capable of flight.

00:09:32.959 --> 00:09:36.220
Four different bodies from one animal!

00:09:36.220 --> 00:09:38.329
Swammerdam also experimented on muscle contraction.

00:09:38.329 --> 00:09:41.970
And, in 1658, he was the first to observe
red blood cells.

00:09:41.970 --> 00:09:47.149
All told, seventeenth-century Holland was
a rad time to be a natural philosopher, asking

00:09:47.149 --> 00:09:48.149
“what is life?”

00:09:48.149 --> 00:09:53.110
As long as you can get your hands on one of Van Leeuwenhoek's microscopes... which apparently only 26 people could.

00:09:53.110 --> 00:09:57.480
But perhaps the greatest early microscopist
was the English polymath Robert Hooke, born

00:09:57.480 --> 00:09:59.709
on the Isle of Wight in 1635.

00:09:59.709 --> 00:10:03.839
Hooke became the curator of experiments of
the Royal Society and did a whole bunch of

00:10:03.839 --> 00:10:07.050
amazing work in science that we’ll have
to explore some other time.

00:10:07.050 --> 00:10:10.029
For now, just google “Micrographia.”

00:10:10.029 --> 00:10:14.899
This is the book Hooke published in 1665,
which was the first book of microscope-enabled

00:10:14.899 --> 00:10:19.879
observations of the natural world, and arguably
the first scientific bestseller.

00:10:19.879 --> 00:10:24.459
It’s also the first instance of the word
“cell” being used to describe a single

00:10:24.459 --> 00:10:29.839
chamber within a living tissue—like the
cell, or small, confined quarters inhabited

00:10:29.839 --> 00:10:30.839
by a monk.

00:10:30.839 --> 00:10:35.410
Like Vesalius, who was obsessed with woodcuts,
and van Leeuwenhoek, who was a manic letter

00:10:35.410 --> 00:10:39.310
writer, Hooke wanted others to see the living
world how he saw it.

00:10:39.310 --> 00:10:45.420
So Micrographia is full of beautiful, tattoo-worthy
illustrations, including a famous one of the

00:10:45.420 --> 00:10:47.160
homely flea.

00:10:47.160 --> 00:10:50.589
In fact, it’s so beautiful that it’s easy
to forget that, even though it was a scientific

00:10:50.589 --> 00:10:53.120
rendering, it was still highly subjective.

00:10:53.120 --> 00:10:57.610
After all, seeing nature through a device
like a microscope or telescope doesn’t make

00:10:57.610 --> 00:10:59.790
you free from your biases.

00:10:59.790 --> 00:11:04.680
And the microscope raised more questions than
the slightly older telescope, because it required

00:11:04.680 --> 00:11:07.019
even more subjective interpretation.

00:11:07.019 --> 00:11:10.910
With only a few good microscopes around in
Hooke’s day, most readers of Micrographia

00:11:10.910 --> 00:11:15.000
couldn’t have confirmed the accuracy of
Hooke’s drawing of a flea, or of anything

00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:16.000
else in that book.

00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:21.519
They just had to trust in the authority of
the professional scientist—one of the first

00:11:21.519 --> 00:11:22.519
in his society.

00:11:22.519 --> 00:11:27.089
Next time—we’ll follow so-called “explorers”
from Eurasia as they travel throughout the

00:11:27.089 --> 00:11:32.540
Americas and Africa, pillaging, classifying,
and… mostly pillaging.

00:11:32.540 --> 00:11:33.360
Stay tuned!

00:11:33.360 --> 00:11:40.200
Crash Course History of Science is filmed in the Dr. Cheryl C. Kinney studio in Missoula, Montana and it’s made with the help of all this nice people

00:11:40.200 --> 00:11:42.200
