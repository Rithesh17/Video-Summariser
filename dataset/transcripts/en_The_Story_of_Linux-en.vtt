00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:13.460
Our story begins 20 years ago. Boris Yeltsin was sworn into office.

00:00:13.460 --> 00:00:19.700
Jay Leno replaced Johnny Carson on The Tonight Show, and cellphones were really, really big.

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:28.800
It was August of 1991 and a 20 year old computer science student named Linus Torvalds sat down at his computer in Helsinki

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:33.460
to post what is now one of the most famous entries in computing history:

00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:43.480
"Hello everybody out there... I'm doing a (free) operating system (just a hobby, won't be anything big and professional like gnu)...

00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:48.680
it probably will never support anything other than AT-hard disks, as that's all I have..."

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:55.780
Well, word of Linux open source project quickly spread around the globe and developers from all over contributed their code.

00:00:55.780 --> 00:01:05.440
Linus named his OS kernel Linux and chose a penguin as its mascot, after a little incident at the zoo.

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:08.980
He soon made a very important decision that would shape

00:01:08.980 --> 00:01:17.600
Linux's future just as much as the technology. He chose: the GPL license created by a visionary named Richard Stallman.

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:27.120
The Linux kernel, along with the GPL license, and other GNU components, revolutionized the computing industry with a few very simple, yet very important freedoms:

00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:30.880
the freedom to use the software for any purpose,

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:34.580
the freedom to change the software to suit your needs,

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:38.720
the freedom to share the software with your friends and neighbors,

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:41.980
and the freedom to share the changes you make.

00:01:41.980 --> 00:01:53.640
These radical ideas fueled its spread around the world and somewhat paradoxically, its rise from a hobbyist experiment to the foundation of a large and thriving commercial ecosystem.

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:56.880
Companies built businesses around Linux.

00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:06.380
In 1999, Red Hat's stock tripled as it became the first Linux company to go public.

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:12.260
That same year, IBM spent a billion dollars to improve and advertise Linux.

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:24.500
Soon, Linux was knocking out industry heavyweights and fueling the rise of the internet with its free software.

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:32.800
In short, Linux revolutionized computing. But whenever something is this disruptive, there's bound to be competitive crossfire.

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:35.920
But Linux not only survived. It thrived.

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:42.980
Today, the kernel development community numbers in the thousands, with hundreds of companies collaborating on Linux development.

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:46.900
Every three months, another version of Linux is released.

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:49.060
So, where is Linux today?

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:58.860
Running in 75% of stock exchanges worldwide and powering the servers that deliver Amazon, Facebook, Twitter, eBay, and Google.

00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:02.260
You use Linux literally every time you surf the internet.

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:12.080
It's in your phone, in your TV, running 95 percent of supercomputers, and in many of the devices you use every day.

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:16.820
Linux is everywhere and the Helsinki-based programmer who started it all,

00:03:16.820 --> 00:03:25.220
he orchestrates this worldwide army of developers from his home office in Portland, Oregon, as a fellow at the Linux Foundation.

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:30.060
As we celebrate 20 years of Linux, we can all see ourselves in its story.

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:35.520
Thank you for being a part of its first 20 years!
