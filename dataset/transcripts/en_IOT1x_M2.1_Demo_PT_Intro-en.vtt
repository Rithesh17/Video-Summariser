SPEAKER: Hello, and welcome to this introductory demo to the network

00:00:06.410 --> 00:00:08.870
simulation tool Cisco Packet Tracer.

00:00:08.870 --> 00:00:11.840
Looking down here at the devices and components

00:00:11.840 --> 00:00:13.700
you can take into to the workspace.

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:15.950
And down here is a submenu of those.

00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:19.220
You can click through, and the name appears there.

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:21.800
And these are the devices themselves.

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:25.740
And you can see the name appearing as the mouse hovers over each one.

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:30.650
So let's take a few out into the workspace by clicking and dragging.

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:37.270
We've got things like an air conditioner unit, fire sprinkler,

00:00:37.270 --> 00:00:41.510
or network-capable devices in this instance.

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:47.960
And looking across here in devices, that's

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:55.265
looking at computers, TVs, phones, and tablets.

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:03.785
Going across here, we have other devices through here, as you can see.

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:09.925
Let's just take a smoke detector.

00:01:09.925 --> 00:01:15.450
If we're looking in here, we've got microcontroller board, single board

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:16.950
computers.

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:24.780
We've got alarms and LEDs.

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:30.660
All can be simulated to be used in Packet Tracer.

00:01:30.660 --> 00:01:43.370
And our Sensors category, we've got humidity sensors,

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:52.030
switches, temperature sensors, lots of other options.

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:56.280
Going back here, we have our actual network devices,

00:01:56.280 --> 00:02:07.670
such as routers and switches, cell towers

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:12.140
to connect mobile devices to the network, and home gateways.

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:22.470
So just say I'm in a menu and I've put something out that I didn't want,

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:26.550
I can either undo it or redo.

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:33.660
Or use this button over here, we'll delete And we switch back, like that.

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:39.090
Now, we also click on the device to view the specifications.

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:43.500
We can see the physical or the configuration settings.

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:50.100
You can view a web browser on devices like a computer,

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:52.520
change the configuration.

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:58.450
All the settings are available by clicking on the device, such as this.

00:02:58.450 --> 00:03:06.910
And just say you were looking to find out the range of outputs,

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:12.080
you can see this is analog represented as 0 to 255,

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:15.160
which is equivalent of 0% to 100%.

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:20.750
So 255 is equal to, "100% humidity," for example.

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:23.420
OK, we have to look at how to actually network

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:28.010
and connect these things together by configuring them and connecting them

00:03:28.010 --> 00:03:30.770
with cables in a future demonstration.

00:03:30.770 --> 00:03:32.900
But for now, that's just a brief introduction.

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:37.030
And you can look around and explore for yourself.
